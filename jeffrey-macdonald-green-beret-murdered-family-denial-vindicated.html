"But I was newly married — three years at the time with a loving and supportive wife. And I had new attorneys offering encouragement saying, 'Times are changing and you never know.' "</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But in order to get parole, he would have had to admit to the murders.

"It would mean admitting to a horrible series of crimes. Why would I admit to that? I did not do these things. And I refuse to lower myself to beg for any relief."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He adds, "I'm going to walk out of prison a vindicated and free man.

We need you to accept your guilt and profess regret,' " he says. "I said, 'I can't do that.' … How could any normal human being say that about himself to walk out on the street? I certainly could not do that."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">MacDonald was ultimately denied parole and told he could not apply again until 2020.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>* Watch the full episode of People Magazine Investigates After Show: The Accused, streaming now on People/Entertainment Weekly Network (PEN).

(Stoeckley and Mitchell are now deceased.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Britt said he was present when prosecutor Jim Blackburn allegedly threatened to charge Stoeckley with murder if she testified to this in court, a claim Blackburn denies. Ultimately, Stoeckley testified that she did not know where she was at the time of the murders.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Britt's claim is now a key part of the "newly discovered evidence" MacDonald's defense hopes will free him: On January 26, the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals will hear oral arguments on his "actual innocence" claim, which has a high burden for overturning a conviction.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>MacDonald Family</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">MacDonald has always said he is innocent.
