It is a bit crude but I never knew it existed.</p><p>"Me and my team were talking about it earlier. Obviously when I do my shows I wear Spanx to keep it all in and make it all fit me.</p><p>"And I sweat a lot and it doesn't go anywhere. So basically I just sit in my own sweat. And my doctor gave me&nbsp;Jock&nbsp;Itch [cream]."</p><p>Also known as <a href=#>tinea curis</a>, jock itch is a <a href=#>fungal infection</a> that causes an itchy and stinging rash on the skin, typically in the groin and inner thighs. It can also affect the buttocks and lower tummy.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on heatwave health ">Read more on heatwave health</h2><p>It's particularly common in athletes, which Adele quipped about on stage.</p><p>The Grammy winning artist added: “So it looks like I am an athlete so I have to squirt it on myself. I don't know why the f*** I just told you that.”</p><p><a href=#>Jock itch rash</a> can appear red, flaky, or scaly on lighter skin, while on darker skin it might look grey or brown, according to <a href=#>healthline</a>.</p><p>With Britain due to be hit by hot weather this weekend, Dr Sarah Welsh, a gynaecologist from London, explained how heatwaves can “play havoc” with your body – especially if you’re wearing tight clothing.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Health</h2></p><p>The 34-year-old pointed out that sweating is completely normal, but she shared helpful tips on how to avoid a sweaty groin as temperatures rise - from how often to wash your bits to what undies to opt for.</p><h2>1. Add - don't strip off - layers</h2><p>Many people's first instinct is to strip off extra layers as <a href=#>temperatures rise</a>.</p><p>But according to Dr Welsh, when it comes to hot weather, it’s actually better to layer up.</p><p>She said: “It might seem counter-intuitive but more is better when it comes to summer clothing."</p><p>However, the kind of layers you don make all the difference, Dr Welsh noted.</p><p>“Choose floaty, loose layers in light colours rather than baring your skin," she advised.</p><p>“Linen is a real winner as it’s breathable, shades your skin from the direct sun and protects you from burning.</p><p>“If you’re commuting in tight clothes on packed trains or battling lack of air conditioning at home, you might find that, like Adele, you’re battling jock itch, or a nasty fungal infection."</p><p>Dr Welsh noted that it's perfectly natural to <a href=#>sweat</a>.</p><p>“Sweating is your body’s natural response to heat, as when the water in your sweat evaporates, it cools the skin.</p><p>“Whilst it’s helpful, it can feel embarrassing or unsightly, especially if you’re in the office.</p><p>“Increased sweating can even cause chafing of the thighs or under your breasts, as moist skin is more prone to damage when it rubs against itself or your clothes.”</p><h2>2. Avoid synthetic materials</h2><p>Cotton, bamboo and linen are your friends during a heatwave.</p><p>Dr Welsh said: “Avoid wearing synthetic underwear!</p><p>“Swap to natural cotton or bamboo underwear if possible, and give nylon tights or shapewear a miss where you can.</p><p>“If you’re wearing shorts to avoid chafing or ‘chub rub’ that lots of us get in a heatwave, try swapping for an anti-chafing balm instead, which allows more breeze to circulate."</p><h2>3. Wash your bits regularly</h2><p>If you’re excessively sweating, it’s good to give your body – especially your genitals – an extra wash now and then.</p><p>Dr Welsh said: “It’s important if you are sweating more than usual to flush it away rather than letting it sit on your skin, so make sure to shower daily and/or a quick rinse of your genitals at the end of the day with fresh, clean water.</p><p>“Avoid heavily perfumed soaps or body washes, even if you’re feeling particularly sweaty, as these can disrupt your vaginal health and cause yeast infections.”</p><h2>Extra tips to stay cool</h2><p>Some of Dr Welsh’s favourite hacks to cool down are super simple -&nbsp;all you need is a running water tap and freezer.</p><p>She said: “Running cool water over your wrists can really help you to chill out, or a damp, cool flannel on the back of your neck.</p><p>“If you’re struggling to sleep at night, a brief shower in cool (not freezing cold!) water can really help to lower your temperature.</p><p>“We’ve heard from Australian friends that lightly dampening a pillow case, freezing it and removing it just before bed can also help to make those sweaty summer nights bearable.”</p><h2>What could happen if you sweat excessively?</h2><p>Sweating is normal but excessive sweating can cause some issues, especially in “moist, dark environments” – such as under the breasts or around the groin.</p><p>Keep an eye out for the below symptoms and if you’re ever in doubt, always consult a medical professional.</p><p>Dr Welsh said: “Yeast infections like nothing better than moist, dark environments.</p><p>“Normally, fungus and bacteria live pretty harmoniously in the vagina, but when the fungus Candida increases, it can cause thrush.</p><p>“The increased temperature of a heatwave can then create the perfect breeding ground for thrush.</p><p>“If you’re working out in tight gym wear in summer, you might also find yourself experiencing bacterial vaginosis.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>“It’s often confused for a yeast infection, but if you notice a distinctive ‘fishy’ smell, greyish, watery discharge or irritation, it’s more likely to be BV.</p><p>“Heat rash can also occur in the groin due to the blockage of sweat ducts, and cause redness, itchy clear blisters or a prickling feeling.”</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">How to treat jock itch</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>You can try the following remedies to get rid of the infection:</p><ul><li>Apply an&nbsp;over-the-counter antifungal&nbsp;cream, powder, or spray to the affected area</li><li>Wash the affected area thoroughly with soap and warm water</li><li>Dry the affected area thoroughly after bathing and exercise</li><li>Change clothes and undergarments every day</li><li>Wear loose cotton clothing</li></ul><p>If symptoms don't improve, speak to a GP and they may prescribe something stronger.</p><p class=has-text-align-right>Source: <a href=# aria-label="healthline (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">healthline</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqGcmqSknXxzfpZvbW1oY2S0sXnAr6ainF2fvKS3jKKrnKBdqMSmrdOyZJyqn6mwqXnSrqSmnaJirqWxy55m</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
