However, Carrie's dress resurfaces in And Just Like That Season 2 when she enlists her former podcast host, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jackie’s (Bobby Lee)</a> wife, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Smoke (Bethlehem Million)</a>, to design her dress for the Met Ball.</p><p>While fitting Carrie for the dress, Smoke struggles to alter it in time for the gala. She eventually asks Carrie if she has anything that could pair with the cape she designed for the Met, and Carrie hesitates before mentioning the wedding dress.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Max</span></figure><p>Though she admitted the gown doesn’t have the most positive sentimental memories, Carrie agreed to wear the dress, and struts out of her apartment rocking the gown and feathered hairpiece.</p><p>Carrie’s wedding dress has been a talked-about look since Sex and the City the movie debuted in theaters worldwide on May 30, 2008. Since the movie aired, many brides-to-be have tried recreating the iconic look. Unfortunately, the exact Vivienne Westwood look isn’t available.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: HBO</a></figure><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Glamour</a>, the Vivienne Westwood “cloud dress” was part of Vivienne’s Winter 2007/2008 collection. In 2009, the dress was available in Vivienne’s London boutique and could be made to order. However, those looking for the exact design had to wait at least six months to get it, and it’s unclear if that’s still an option today.</p><p>Online stores like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Net A Porter</a> also created a shorter dress with a similar design in 2009, but it doesn’t seem to be available, either. Additionally, Vivienne Westwood designed several pieces inspired by Carrie’s wedding dress to honor the movie’s 10th anniversary in 2018.</p><p>Unfortunately, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Marie Claire</a> stated in May 2018 that the collection was only available from May-June of that year. While <a href=#>Vivienne passed away in December 2022</a>, the Vivienne Westwood collection still has many other beautiful gowns that Carrie would surely approve of!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmK6vediorGaapa56pK3Rq6Ceq12ssqWwyKeeZpyimsC0</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
