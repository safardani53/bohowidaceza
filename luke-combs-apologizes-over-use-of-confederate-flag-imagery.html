I’m just looking … not to say, ‘I’m so sorry, please forgive me.’ I’m here to say, ‘I’m trying to learn. I’m trying to get better.’ I know that I’m a very highly visible member of the country music community right now, and I want to use that position for good and to say that people can change, and people do want to change, and I’m one of those people trying.”</p><p>Combs — a native of North Carolina — went on to explain that he is “proud” of his Southern roots, adding that the Confederate flag “was an image that I associated to mean something else” when he was growing up. The musician assured fans his views have changed, however.</p><p>“I’ve grown in my time as an artist, and as the world has changed drastically … I am now aware how painful that image can be to someone else. And no matter what I thought at the time … I would ever want to be associated with something that brings so much hurt to someone else.”</p><p>Combs’ apology comes amid <a href=#>a time of controversy</a> in country music. Rising star <a href=#><strong>Morgan Wallen</strong></a> recently came under fire after video surfaced of him <a href=#>using the N-word</a> after a night out.</p><p>Wallen, 27, was <a href=#>dropped by his record label</a>, Big Loud Records, and several radio stations. The Academy of Country Music later announced that his “potential involvement and eligibility” for the upcoming ACM Awards has been halted.</p><p>The “More Than My Hometown” singer revealed on February 10 that he was “<a href=#>nine days sober</a>” following the incident. He also asked fans to stop defending him.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Luke-Combs-Apologizes-After-Music-Video-Featuring-Confederate-Flag-Surfaces-002.jpg><p>“I let so many people down,” Wallen said. “I let my parents down and they’re the furthest thing from … the person in that video. I let my son down, and I’m not OK with that.”</p><p>Wallen continued: “It’s not all that long of a time, but it’s enough to know the man in that video is not the many that I’m trying to be.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKOuo5VisLC5waxkmqifobyotdmeqmanppq%2FbsHSnmSonl2YvK%2ByxJ2cq5mkmnqnuMCgZKKlkZyys8WO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
