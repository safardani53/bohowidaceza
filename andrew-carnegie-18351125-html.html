Carnegie led the expansion of America's steel industry in the late 19th century and became one of the richest Americans in history. He became a prominent philanthropist in the United States and the British Empire. During the last 18 years of his life, he donated about $ 350 million to charities, foundations and universities - nearly 90% of his fortune. His 1889 article proclaiming the "The Gospel of Wealth" called on the rich to use their wealth to improve society and spark a wave of philanthropy. Carnegie was born in Dunfermline, Scotland, and immigrated to the United States with his parents in 1848 at the age of 12. Carnegie began working as a telegraph operator, and by the 1860s invested in railroads, carriages, bridges and docks. He amassed new wealth as a bond seller, raising money for an American company in Europe.</p><table class=wikibox readability=18><tr readability=6><td class=wk_label>Born</td><td class=wk_value>November 25, 1835, Dunfermline, Fife, Scotland</td></tr><tr readability=6><td class=wk_label>Died</td><td class=wk_value>August 11, 1919, Lenox, Massachusetts, U.S.</td></tr><tr readability=5><td class=wk_label>Resting place</td><td class=wk_value>Sleepy Hollow Cemetery, Sleepy Hollow, New York, U.S.</td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=wk_label>Occupation</td><td class=wk_value>Industrialist, Philanthropist</td></tr><tr readability=10><td class=wk_label>Known for</td><td class=wk_value>Founding and leading the Carnegie Steel Company Founding the Carnegie Library, Carnegie Institution for Science, Carnegie Corporation of New York, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Carnegie Mellon University, Carnegie Trust for the Universities of Scotland, and the Carnegie Hero Fund</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Political party</td><td class=wk_value>Republican</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Children</td><td class=wk_value>Margaret Carnegie Miller</td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=wk_label>Parent(s)</td><td class=wk_value>William Carnegie, Margaret Morrison Carnegie</td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=wk_label>Relatives</td><td class=wk_value>Thomas M.
