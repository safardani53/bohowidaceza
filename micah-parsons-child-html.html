You growing up to fast on me!” he emotionally penned his caption.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>Does Micah Parsons Have a Wife?</h2><p>As stated earlier, there has been no revelation regarding&nbsp;Parsons’s baby mama so far.</p><p>Due to the same privacy, it is again unclear if he is still with his baby mama, dating another girlfriend, married to a wife, or still single. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>But a tweet from&nbsp;Jon Machota, a journalist covering the <a href=# rel=follow>Dallas Cowboys</a> for The Athletic, hinted at the Cowboys player being single and living with his mom and son.</p><p>In the tweet,&nbsp;Machota <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">revealed a message</a>&nbsp;Parsons sent in a group chat with Cowboys teammates, reading, “If you don’t got your family in town or your wife don’t feel like cooking (for Thanksgiving), you’re more than welcome to come to my house.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>“My mom makes enough for about 100 people. Anybody can come. I always enjoy bonding,” the message further stated.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>That said, the tweet does not fully clarify&nbsp;Parsons’ relationship status; hence, one needs to wait for official news in the future.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKWZmK6pec%2Baqaynnqh6pLTIpZtnoKSiuQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
