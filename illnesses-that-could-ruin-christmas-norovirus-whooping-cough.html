Flu</h2><p>Flu is always a concern at this time of year.</p><p><a aria-label="Recent UK Health Security Agency stats (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Recent UK Health Security Agency stats</a> have shown that cases in England have crept up in recent weeks, with the number of people down with the flu rising by 2.3 per cent in the week before December 7.</p><p>Hospitalisations also rose slightly in that same time period.</p><p>While most people can recover from the flu at home, it's likely you won't feel up to participating in Christmas celebrations - not to mention that you shouldn't, as the virus is very transmissible.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Health</h2></p><p>Symptoms of the flu can come on all at once and i<a href=#>n as little as one or two days after you're infected</a> with the virus.</p><p>They include:</p><p>The best thing you can do is rest, drink plenty of liquids, take pain killers and stay away from others.</p><p>But seek help if your symptoms persist for over a week.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>2. Covid</h2><p>Covid has ruined Christmas celebrations nationwide before.</p><p>And now, medics have now raised the alarm over a new, "highly transmissible" variant dubbed JN.1, which they fear could hit hospitals already packed with flu and norovirus patients.</p><p>UKHSA scientist Dr Meaghan Kall said it appears to be one of the fastest spreading&nbsp;<a href=#>variants seen this year</a>.</p><p>Having flagged it at the end of October, the agency has tracked 301 cases of it in the UK - but the true number is likely to be far higher due to so few people testing.</p><p>So far, experts don't expect symptoms of this new variant to differ hugely from previous ones.</p><p>The&nbsp;<a href=#>Zoe Covid Symptom Study</a>, which collects data on self-reported symptoms in the UK, said the 10 most common symptoms currently are:</p><li>A sore throat</li><li>A runny nose</li><li>A blocked nose</li><li>Sneezing</li><li>A cough without phlegm</li><li>A headache</li><li>A cough with phlegm</li><li>A hoarse voice</li><li>Muscle aches and pains</li><li>An altered sense of smell</li><p>The NHS advises you try to stay home and avoid contact with other people for five days after you test positive for Covid.</p><p>It's also important you avoid people who are more likely to get seriously ill from it for 10 days after you take your test.</p><p>That means it's wise not to mingle with grandparents over the festive period if you think you have Covid.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>3. Respiratory syncytial virus&nbsp;(RSV)</h2><p>RSV is an extremely common virus that most kids will pick up at some point before they're two,&nbsp;NHS&nbsp;guidance states.</p><p>In most cases, it will cause mild and cold-like symptoms, but some tots might develop a chest infection called bronchiolitis from RSV.</p><p><a aria-label="Recent UKHSA figures (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Recent UKHSA figures</a> suggest that RSV cases were "stable" in England, but the number of people being admitted to the emergency department for acute bronchiolitis had increased in the week leading up to December 7.</p><p>Children under five were the most affected.</p><p>RSV symtpoms tend to include:</p><p>As for bronchiolitis, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Asthma + Lung UK</a> said mild symptoms are:</p><ul><li>A slightly high temperature – a normal temperature for babies and children tends to be about 36.4C</li><li>A dry and persistent raspy cough</li><li>Some difficulty feeding</li><li>Some difficulty breathing or fast breathing</li><li>Noisy breathing - also known as wheezing</li></ul><p>But parents should seek medical help for their little ones if their bronchiolitis symptoms get worse and they are having difficulty breathing or develop a high temperature.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>4. Whooping cough</h2><p>Whooping cough, also known as&nbsp;pertussis, is a bacterial infection of the lungs and breathing tubes characterised by a distinctive 'whoop' sound as sufferers gasp for breath between coughs.</p><p>Recent government data showed that as&nbsp;many as 716 could have been infected with whooping cough in&nbsp;<a href=#>England</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=#>Wales</a>&nbsp;between July and November 26 - a worrying spike from the number of cases recorded last year.</p><p>The illness spreads very easily and can last for several weeks or months - hence being called the 100-day-cough.</p><p>Hospital treatment is usually needed if symptoms become severe.</p><p>Leading virologist Prof Richard Tedder told Sun Health cases would likely rise over Christmas, so he advised people wear masks and those that are eligible to get the vaccine for it to do so.</p><p>The first signs of whooping cough are similar to a&nbsp;cold, such as a runny nose and sore throat. A high temperature is uncommon.</p><p>After about a week, you may:</p><ul><li>Get coughing bouts that last for a few minutes and are worse at night</li><li>Make a "whoop" sound – a gasp for breath between coughs - but note that young babies and some adults may not "whoop"</li><li>Have difficulty breathing after a coughing bout and may turn blue or grey (young infants)</li><li>Bring up a thick mucus, which can make you vomit</li><li>Become very red in the face (more common in adults)</li></ul><p>The NHS advises people see their GP if they or their child have the symptoms of whooping cough, or have had a cough for more than three weeks that is getting worse.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>5. Pneumonia</h2><p>Pneumonia is an inflammation of the lungs that's usually caused by an infection and can see an uptick in the winter months.</p><p>It usually needs to be treated with antibiotics and most people will recover within about two to four weeks.</p><p>However, babies and older people might need hospital treatment.</p><p>Symptoms include:</p><ul><li>A cough – you may cough up yellow or green mucus (phlegm)</li><li>Shortness of breath</li><li>A high temperature</li><li>Chest pain</li><li>An aching body</li><li>Feeling very tired</li><li>Loss of appetite</li><li>Making wheezing noises when you breathe – babies may also make grunting noises</li><li>Feeling confused – this is common in older people</li></ul><p>The best thing you can do if you have pneumonia is rest, avoid contact with people, drink plenty of fluids and take paracetamol or ibuprofen to ease your symptoms.</p><p>Pneumonia is usually caused by a bacterial or viral infection, so you can catch it from someone who has it, the NHS said.</p><p>It's also possible to develop the infection after getting flu or Covid.</p><p>China, the US, various European countries and more recently <a href=#>Wales</a> have reported outbreaks of the respiratory infection mycoplasma pneumonia.</p><p>It's thought to be a milder form of of viral or bacterial pneumonia, but its symptoms may last longer.</p><p>These usually include a&nbsp;fever, cough,&nbsp;bronchitis, sore throat, headache and tiredness.</p><p>In some cases, it can cause more severe illness, which can require a course of&nbsp;antibiotics or result in hospitalisation.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>6. Norovirus</h2><p>Another joy of the festive season is norovirus -what's known as the winter vomiting bug.</p><p>The highly contagious virus causes sudden bouts of projectile vomiting and diarrhoea.</p><p>And unfortunately for us, norovirus cases in England <a href=#>rose a staggering 41 per cent</a> in the two weeks leading to November 26.</p><p>Patients have <a href=#>described it </a>like "the worst hangover ever".</p><p>Aside from being sick, suffers might also have aching arms and legs, a high temperature, abdominal pain, and a headache, according to the&nbsp;NHS.</p><p>It's very easy to catch from someone else with the virus, by touching infected surfaces or objects, or by eating&nbsp;food&nbsp;that has been&nbsp;<a href=#>prepared by someone</a>&nbsp;with it.</p><p>So if you have norovirus symptoms, you shouldn't even think about cooking Christmas dinner.</p><p>There are ways to curb the spread of it, by being diligent with washing your hands with soap and warm water - hand sanitiser alnoe does not work - washing food before you prepare and eat it, and cooking it thoroughly.</p><p>You should also routinely sanitise surfaces.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>7. Common cold</h2><p>A cold certainly seems like the lesser of the seven evils listed here.</p><p>But a sniffle and a sore throat can still cramp your Christmas style.</p><p>Unlike flu, symptoms of a common cold come on gradually and include:</p><ul><li>A blocked or runny nose</li><li>A sore throat</li><li>Headaches</li><li>Muscle aches</li><li>Coughs</li><li>Sneezing</li><li>A raised temperature</li><li>Pressure in your ears and face</li><li>Loss of taste and smell</li></ul><p>You might still be able to partake in some Christmas celebrations, but it's best to stay home from the party if you have a temperature or are feeling unwell.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>You can ease your symptoms with painkillers and decongestant sprays.</p><p>Make sure you bin used tissues quickly and wash your hands often to avoid spreading your germs.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57x56YpayYZIZ5f5Ryam9nmaG5r7HSrJysZaSdrrV5wqispZxdp8Kquoycn6uho6m6or%2BMp6arp6aev7a%2FjLCfqKegnruoecKorKCgXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
