the largest amount in the 12-hour period - with the country's August average just 97.4mm.</p><p>This was closely followed by Shap in Cumbria, which recorded 38.6mm - more than half of England's August 69mm average.</p><p>Gwent in Wales clocked 34.8mm - a third of the country's 107mm August rainfall average.</p><p>Amid the heavy rain and the threat of flooding, the Environment Agency (EA) advised people to "stay away from swollen rivers" and not to drive through flood water as "just 30cm of flowing water is enough to move your car".</p><p>The EA said homeowners and drivers can now see flood warnings on Google Search and the Google Public Alerts map on their phones or computers.</p><p>Strong winds are also expected to cause disruption, with the Met Office warning stretching across west Wales, Devon and Cornwall, to parts of the Channel coast.</p><p>Saturday's wind warning covers the whole of Wales and southern and central England as far north as Blackpool, Huddersfield and Grimsby.</p><p>The threat of slow-moving, heavy thundery showers - which could cause torrential downpours - has also prompted a yellow thunderstorm warning.</p><p>Covering Northern Ireland, northern England and much of Scotland, it warns that there could be damage to buildings from floodwater or lightning strikes, as well as power cuts.<br></p><h2>POWER CUT CHAOS</h2><p>The warning comes after a <a href=#>power cut caused chaos across the country</a> as trains were cancelled and traffic lights stopped working during rush hour.</p><p>Ms Diamond said that the rainfall is "pretty unseasonable for August" and along with the thunderstorms and predicted blustery conditions - with potential gusts of 60mph - the weather might "catch some people out".</p><p>Several festivals and events have been cancelled in the wake of the weather warnings, and motorists and commuters have also been told to avoid travelling if possible.</p><p>The warnings also cover Whaley Bridge, where around 1,500 residents were recently allowed home after the damaged Toddbrook Reservoir was deemed safe.</p><p>Derbyshire Police released a statement on Thursday afternoon which said if the water reached a "level of concern, the residents in the evacuation zone will be the first to know".</p><p>The weather warnings will be cut back on Sunday to cover only northern England and Scotland, where thunderstorms are likely, and none are currently in place for Monday.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN NEWS</h2></p><p>Richard Leonard, head of road safety at Highways England, urged drivers to check conditions before they travel and "consider if their journey is necessary".</p><p>"In high winds, there's a particular risk to lorries, caravans and motorbikes so we'd advise drivers of these vehicles to slow down and avoid using exposed sections of road if possible," he said.</p><p>The RNLI has also warned people visiting the coast to beware of large waves and storms.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Here's the latest rainfall radar 📡</p><p>Heavy, thundery downpours are still rumbling across northern areas, with a few sharp showers in the south too 🌧️ <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/fVoPHaN9dn</a></p>— Met Office (@metoffice) <a href=#>August 10, 2019</a><br><p><b>We pay for your stories!
