Cameron shared that since vying for <strong><a href=#>Hannah Brown</a></strong>’s attention during season 15 of the reality television show, the way he looks at women has “completely changed.”</p><p>“I think before, to be completely honest, I went through dating as like, ‘I’m just a little kid from a small town, like now I’m in L.A., New York. I didn’t come this far just to date somebody back in the small town. Like I’m gonna take a crack at models, actresses, and all these things,’” Cameron — who was <a href=#>Brown’s runner-up</a> — said.</p><p>Directly <a href=#>following the show</a>, Cameron was linked to supermodel <a href=#><strong>Gigi Hadid</strong></a>, attending the 2019 MTV Video Music Awards afterparty together. Hadid, 28, even invited Cameron to the Netherlands to attend her grandmother’s funeral. But the romance was short-lived, with Us Weekly <a href=#>confirming their split</a> in October 2019.</p><p>One month later, Us broke the news that Cameron was “hooking up” with <strong><a href=#>Kylie Jenner</a></strong>’s best friend,<a href=#><strong> Stassie Karanikolaou</strong></a>. He has also been linked to <strong><a href=#>Camila Kendra</a></strong> and <strong><a href=#>Paige Lorenze</a>&nbsp;</strong>since his time on the show.</p><p>Ultimately, Cameron told Viall, 42, his time with <a href=#>supermodels didn’t work out</a>. “I did all that and I’m like, ‘Well, this got me nowhere,’” he said. Eventually, however, he went through a heartbreak that got him “back in check” with his values.</p><p>“I was dating a girl and everything she cared about was everything I didn’t care about,” Cameron recalled. “Money, fame, all these things. All I cared about was wanting to have a family, live a certain lifestyle. She wanted a private jet, boats, all these things.”</p><p>As for <a href=#>what he’s searching for now</a>, Cameron described himself as “simple.”</p><p>“I want to have land, I want to live on the water and just be with my kids,” he told Viall. “I want to coach high school football and like that’s it. I don’t think a lot of people can fit into that.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Viall, for his part, teased his friend’s new romantic approach via <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a>.</p><p>“Tyler’s new vision board: Babies ✅ Small Town lady ✅ models ❌ Actresses ❌.
