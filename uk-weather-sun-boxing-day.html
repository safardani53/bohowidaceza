large parts of Britain over the coming days, forecasters said.</p><p>Met Office expert Frank Saunders said: "Storm Gerrit will run towards western UK on Wednesday and bring with it potential impacts for much of the UK.</p><p>"Winds across southern coastal areas of England will be strong, possibly peaking around 70 mph on exposed coastlines, but more widely around 50-60 mph within the warning area.</p><p>"Rain is an additional hazard from Storm Gerrit, with active weather fronts leading to a wet day for many.</p><p>"Snow is also likely to cause problems for some northern areas: only briefly for a few upland routes across the Pennines and southern Scotland overnight and early on Wednesday, but more widely to the north of the Central Lowlands later in the day.</p><p>"Here around 10 to possibly 20cm of snow may affect some of the highest routes, this combining with very strong winds to lead to some difficult travel conditions.</p><p>"At lower levels a combination of heavy rain and very strong winds will dominate."</p><p>It comes as snow is falling a day late for Christmas today- with festive families taking to their sledges and hardy swimmers going for a dip.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The Sun</h2></p><p>Snaps taken this morning in the Scottish Highlands village of Carrbridge show families making the most of the snowfall.</p><p>The photos show kids sledding, couples walking and 4x4s trundling along iced-over roads.</p><p>Wintry showers will continue to soak the far north of <a href=#>Scotland</a> today, with an ice <a href=#>warning</a> earlier this morning.</p><p>Today most Brits will enjoy a fine day with some decent sunshine and temperatures around the annual average.</p><p>Swimmers were spotted going for a dip in Liverpool's Salthouse dock, at Aberdeen Beach and in Perranporth, Cornwall.</p><p>Wind and rain will start pushing across the southwest later today, with the sky clouding over tonight after a clear start.</p><p>By dawn tomorrow, the cloud and scattered rain will have spread to all parts of the country.</p><p>The <a href=#>Met Office</a> has issued a string of different yellow weather warnings for the UK tomorrow.</p><p>Wind will buffet the south coast from 3am until 6pm, sparking <a href=#>travel</a> chaos including for ferry passengers.</p><p>There is also a risk of flooding in the southwest until 3pm and in <a href=#>Wales</a> and the north west until 6pm.</p><p>Most of Scotland will be covered by a yellow warning for rain and <a href=#>snow</a> between 6am and midnight, with a chance of power cuts and flooding.</p><p>Up to 15cm could fall on high ground, scrambling transport routes over the glens.</p><p>In the past hour new warnings have been issued for the Shetlands, Northern Ireland, the Outer Hebrides and a large swathe of northern England.</p><p>It will be a bit brighter on Thursday, with the downpours easing into showers.</p><p>But there will still be yellow wind warnings in place for the Shetlands and for the west coast from south Wales up to the Scottish border.</p><p>Heading into the weekend there will still be some hill snow in the north and wind in the south.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>The run-up to the <a href=#>New Year</a> is also likely to be unsettled - a fitting end to a year marred by a summer washout and a punishing winter.</p><p>The first week of 2024 will be much the same, with the mercury hovering around the average.</p><p class=postsid
