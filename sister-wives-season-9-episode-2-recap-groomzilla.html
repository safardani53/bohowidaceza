The date was fast approaching, so they needed to try and get ahead of things.&nbsp;</p><p>However, Christine took issue with the fact that Tony was joining them, and it’s understandable why. It’s not exactly traditional for the husband-to-be to go along for the process, but Tony seemed dead set on doing the opposite of what everyone wanted.&nbsp;</p><p>While Mykelti and Anna were looking for the dresses, Christine made sure Tony was proving his worth. She wanted to know whether he had sorted the pinatas out.&nbsp;</p><p>He admitted that he wanted life-sized pinatas of himself and Mykelti, and he wanted his new wife to break his open.&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, that did not go down well.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/12/mykelti-brown-and-antonio-padron-are-married-1024x556.png><p>The conversation quickly turned to the dress Mykelti brought out, and not everyone was impressed with it. The negative comments put a dampener on the whole day.&nbsp;</p><p>Then, Tony went one step further and started to make comments about the way he wanted Mykelti to wear her hair on the big day. Again, the mothers disagreed with him.&nbsp;</p><p>After that, Christine went to a voice lesson to somehow improve her voice before the big day. Yes, she was still making it known that she was singing at the wedding.&nbsp;</p><p>Elsewhere, Meri continued to get over-enthusiastic about the whole running a bed and breakfast. If you watch Sister Wives online, you will already know that Meri is one of the most out there wives, so it makes sense that she’s not giving up on her plans.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/01/meri-brown-poses-with-a-chair-647x1024.png><p>The house she wanted to purchase to run the business was her great-grand parent’s house. The house did go down a treat with the other wives, but it became clear Meri wanted to keep it in her family.&nbsp;</p><p>Kody continued to be cynical about it, and he may have a point. There were only four rooms to rent out, so it’s difficult to imagine the place turning in much of a profit.&nbsp;</p><p>Then, they found out that one of the rooms is haunted, and the wives seemed to get on board when they heard about it. The reason? More money.&nbsp;</p><p>But things did not go down well when Meri said she planned on having an apartment there in case she was in town. The other wives thought this would mean Meri would be away from them for good.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Meri said that it would make her happy to have the business, but reiterated that she would not leave the family. Meri made her best point yet: She had no kids at home, so she wanted to challenge herself.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, Maddie&nbsp;returned home with Caleb and dropped a bomb of epic proportions:</p><p>She was pregnant!&nbsp;</p><p>This represented a milestone because it would be the first grandchild in the family.&nbsp; It’s hard to believe, we know.&nbsp;</p><p>What did you think of the episode?</p><p>Hit the comments!</p><p><strong>Sister Wives continues Sundays on TLC.&nbsp;</strong></p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>Meri Brown: 19 Shocking Facts About the Sister Wives Star!</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pwX2V%2BcL%2FIrKueql2strex0maqnpmjpLtuhYyep6Krn5mybn6Mq5ycmaBitLO7zqaxoqSclnw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
