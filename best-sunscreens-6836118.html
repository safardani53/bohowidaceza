And while it may be easy finding ways to get your daily dose of H2O in (fruit-infused water, anyone?), finding the perfect <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>sunscreen for the face</a> or body can prove to be a bit more challenging. There are the ingredients of the sunscreen to consider as well as your skin type and level of activity, not to mention the kind of formula (serum, spray, or lotion) that'll best suit your needs. Seems like a lot (and that's because it is), but it's a job that has to be done if you're looking to dodge sun spots, fine lines, and wrinkles (at best) and skin cancer (at worst).<span class=ql-inline-citation data-cite=1></span></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We're passionate about keeping our skin protected and healthy, so we set out to find the best sunscreens on the market, putting 52 of them to the test, and eventually narrowing it down to 16 of the best ones. All 16 of these sunscreens passed the transfer, blendability, opacity, and water-resistance tests — leaving us with impressive protection, luminosity, and absolutely zero white casts.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">After a day of testing in the lab, these 15 sunscreens got our PEOPLE Tested stamp of approval.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-black-girl-sunscreen-broad-spectrum-spf-30></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Overall</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Black Girl Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 30</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Black Girl Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 30" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/KSs0leN9reywyjQ7p52183nLzn4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/black-girl-sunscreen-spf-30-d576cc80751a49ddb67c544503458771.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Transfer</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Opacity</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.7</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Water Resistance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Removal</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1.5><li readability=-1><p>Its sheer formula felt ultralight on our skin</p></li><li readability=-1><p>The ingredients are completely reef-friendly</p></li><li readability=2><p>Free of parabens, fragrance, oxybenzone, and octinoxate</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">After testing each sunscreen formula, it was clear that the Black Girl Sunscreen SPF 30 was the winner. This sunscreen is made with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>melanated skin</a> in mind, meaning you shouldn't be able to detect a white cast on your skin. Instead of leaving a white undertone or making our testers’ skin look dull, it added a boost of radiance, making them look luminous and refreshed, which is, quite frankly, the dream.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The sheer formula is laced with jojoba, cacao, and avocado to provide a light veil of moisture — perfect if you're the type to forget about applying moisturizer. Consistency-wise, we were fans. It has an incredibly light feel and spread across our skin very nicely, not veering too far on the oily or creamy side, making it perfect for all skin types. It also passed the water-resistance test with flying colors, never removing the sunscreen or affecting the glow it leaves behind. This is great news if you plan on wearing this sunscreen around the beach or pool or if you sweat a lot.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">However, we did notice one minor packaging flaw: the mouth of the tube would make the product easier to use if it were tighter. The sunscreen comes out very easily, making it easy to accidentally waste the product if you have a heavy hand (telling you now so you know for later). Aside from this, the under-$20 price tag and easily blendable formula makes this product a no-brainer if you're looking for your next go-to sunscreen.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>3 fl. oz.<strong> </strong>| <strong>Type: </strong>Chemical | <strong>SPF Rating: </strong>30</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=5615 data-sizes=750px alt="Black Girl Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 30 on marble counter next to toothbrush in cup" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/Fi1qD43NL3x9Eup1Wzh2LLc5KAs=/fit-in/1500x5615/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/peo-product-black-girl-sunscreen-jthompson-0397.jpg-b7043d0577154e4eab5b08705869175f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Jhett Thompson</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=5792 data-sizes=750px alt="Open tube of Black Girl Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 30 on marble counter" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/vcQMfaZAphwtPOY2dtK8IFKhTyY=/fit-in/1500x5792/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/peo-product-black-girl-sunscreen-jthompson-0400.jpg-e571ef06ee3041a18c4066deee39c3e6.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Jhett Thompson</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-unscented-cetaphil-sheer-mineral-face-sunscreen-spf-50-for-sensitive-skin></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Unscented</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Cetaphil Mineral Face Sunscreen SPF 50</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Sheer Mineral Face Sunscreen SPF 50 for Sensitive Skin" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/zv9sYrDTOkR-ART1R_2FnA9Uhp4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/SheerMineralFaceSunscreenSPF50forSensitiveSkin-34d5b5f5ce34462ebac8e2cff5fa8e7b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Walgreens</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Transfer</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Opacity</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Water Resistance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>We appreciated this one’s budget-friendly price tag</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Its smaller ounce count is TSA-approved</p></li><li readability=-1><p>The fragrance-free formula is ideal for those with sensitive skin</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There isn't much not to love about Cetaphil's Sheer Mineral Liquid Sunscreen: It is SPF 50, travel-friendly, and sits at less than $11. We were impressed by the lightweight formula too, appreciating its lack of any greasy residue that sunscreen tends to leave after first applying. It also didn't transfer before or after transfer test, which always earns points in our book. And because it's unscented and hypoallergenic, it's gentle enough for those with sensitive skin.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">However, we did notice that the formula tended to be pretty watery and took a little elbow grease to fully blend into our skin. But once it was all rubbed in, you could not spot the sunscreen in the slightest. Overall, we were fans of the easy-to-use applicator and how a little product goes a long way, which makes us think that we’ll be able to get a considerable amount of use out of this small tube. Even if you’re not jetting off to a tropical destination, it’s a great size to throw in a bag for easy, everyday access.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>1.7 fl. oz.<strong> </strong>| <strong>Type: </strong>Mineral | <strong>SPF Rating: </strong>50</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-banana-boat-light-as-air-faces></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Budget</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Banana Boat Face Sunscreen</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Banana Boat Light As Air Faces" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/-FmgeWNJP4MFZyW7EJ_SPBqAMF0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/BananaBoatLightAsAirFaces-b563e1ff42db41c3a794358b6394647c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Transfer</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Opacity</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Water Resistance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1><li readability=-1><p>This winner is just as effective as it is budget-friendly</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It has a light and fast-absorbing formula</p></li><li readability=1><p>The gentle formula is non-comedogenic, so it’s safe to be used on your face, too</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Plagued by the thick, goopy drugstore sunscreen formulations of the past? Not anymore with Banana Boat's Light As Air Faces SPF 50. True to its name, we loved how lightweight this felt and how it was barely noticeable on our skin. It also didn't transfer before or after the blotting test or require a ton of blending upon initial application. The quick-absorbing formula doesn't require any downtime (great for impatient folks who need to run out the door) — plus, it's non-comedogenic and won't clog pores, so it's great for those with oily, acne-prone skin types.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When it came to testing its resistance to water, the droplets tended to bead up on top of our skin, which kept the product from running. We noticed that the squeeze-tube packaging wasn’t the easiest for distribution, so it’s worth keeping this in mind if you typically prefer a pump on your sunscreen. But this formula gets major brownie points for not leaving behind a greasy residue on our skin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>3 fl. oz.<strong> </strong>| <strong>Type: </strong>Chemical | <strong>SPF Rating: </strong>50</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Jhett Thompson</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-sport-hawaiian-tropic-everyday-active-sport-sunscreen-lotion></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Sport</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Hawaiian Tropic Everyday Active Sunscreen Lotion</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Hawaiian Tropic Everyday Active Sport Sunscreen Lotion" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/8Aq2Pp8wMC4v6FWKcLNOTvYhuKA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/hawaiian-tropic-everyday-active-sunscreen-cb999aabccb74ad18899119f0a8ba4b5.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Transfer</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Opacity</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Water Resistance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1><li readability=-1><p>There’s a large volume of product for the price</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It felt breathable during sweaty workouts and long beach days</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Its non-greasy formula left a radiant finish on our skin</p></li><li readability=-1><p>The ingredients are reef-friendly</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">So, you live an active lifestyle and need a sunscreen that can keep up? Pick up this one from Hawaiian Tropic Island, the perfect companion for surfers, hikers, and pool-goers alike. You get a lot of sunscreen for a very low price — great for those constantly outdoors and needing to replenish their sunscreens quickly.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Even though this formula has a thicker consistency, we were pleased by how quickly and easily it absorbed into our skin. It also didn’t leave a film or cast on our skin, and it passed the transfer test with flying colors. To top it all off, it had a delicate, tropical scent that wasn't overpowering, instead transporting us to a palm-tree peppered destination in our minds. With an 80-minute water- and sweat-resistant claim to back it up, consider this your next beach bag must-have for outdoor activities.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>8 fl. oz.<strong> </strong>| <strong>Type: </strong>Chemical | <strong>SPF Rating: </strong>50</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Jhett Thompson</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-face-supergoop-unseen-sunscreen-spf-40></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Face</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Supergoop!

Unseen Sunscreen. Working as a makeup-gripping primer, a hydrating (yet non-greasy) base, and a broad spectrum SPF 40 protectant all in one, this product goes into overdrive to give you a moisturized base that's equipped to take on whatever kind of day you have ahead — from makeup-free outdoor adventures to full-glam evenings. Its thick, translucent formula glided onto our skin smoothly, leaving us with a velvety surface that we likened to a silicone primer and prepping our skin for foundation and concealer. To make things even better, its roster of nourishing ingredients provided benefits for different skin types — moisturizing dry skin and controlling shine for oily complexions.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It repelled the water that we sprayed on it during the resistance test, instead of beading up on top of our skin (meaning a bit of sweat won't mess up your sunscreen or makeup). It took some time to dry down, and we noticed the slightest transfer during a blotting test, but these aren't dealbreakers.

And it's no wonder — the weightless sunscreen has a barely-there texture and creates the ultimate dewy base layer that looks beautiful underneath makeup. Though we were skeptical at first because of the orange pigment, we found that this sunscreen rubbed into a big range of skin tones without leaving any kind of cast. Plus, it features both hyaluronic acid and vitamin B5 to quench your skin's thirst as well as sea lavender to boost collagen production.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Over the course of six months, we continued to reach for this gorgeous sunscreen (especially on no-makeup makeup days). The only thing we would like to see an improvement on is transferability. Though water alone did not remove the product from our skin, when wiped with the black T-shirt, it did remove a small layer of the sunscreen. Still, considering its multi-use qualities and the radiant finish it leaves on the skin, we think this pick is definitely worth the try. One of our editors even wrote an <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>in-depth review</a> of this face sunscreen because she loves it so much.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>1.7 fl. oz.<strong> </strong>| <strong>Type: </strong>Chemical | <strong>SPF Rating: </strong>40</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-8 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=4359 data-sizes=750px alt="A person applying Supergoop!

Made out of 100 percent zinc oxide, this mineral sunscreen offers up an SPF 50 rating and is especially good for those with sensitive skin types. Its sheer, gentle, and nourishing, with ingredients like vitamin E and oat to back it up.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It’s worth noting that this one does have a very slight scent (almost reminiscent of baby powder), which is something to keep in mind if you're not into scented products. Aside from this, this facial sunscreen is sweat- and water-resistant for up to 80 minutes, and water instantly beads up when it touches your skin, without so much as a budge or white cast in sight. This makes it a great option to pack on your next beach vacation (and it's a good thing you can, since it's TSA-friendly at two fluid ounces).&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>2 fl. oz.<strong> </strong>| <strong>Type: </strong>Mineral | <strong>SPF Rating: </strong>50</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Jhett Thompson</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-lotion-la-roche-posay-anthelios-melt-in-milk-sunscreen-spf-60></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Lotion</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>La Roche-Posay Anthelios Melt-In Milk Sunscreen</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="La Roche-posay Anthelios Melt-in Sunscreen Milk SPF 60" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/8hIkcA28jPdF9sDumq9Dfg0JzrM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/la-roche-posay-anthelios-melt-in-sunscreen-milk-spf-60-78fcbfa1ad164b2f9216282aea41685a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Transfer</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Opacity</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Water Resistance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>Its noncomedogenic formula can be used on your face and body</p></li><li readability=-1><p>The pigment-free formula works on all skin tones</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Its thin consistency felt weightless on our skin</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">A little goes a long way with this formula from La Roche Posay, and though it feels lightweight, it certainly keeps you protected with SPF 60. Not only does it feature a unique antioxidant complex that keeps free radicals at bay, but it's formulated with the brand's thermal spring water to soothe and protect the skin. We like that this formula can be used on both the face and body for all-over coverage and protection, making it a great option for those who prefer to use one do-it-all sunscreen versus two separate formulas.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">True to its name, the velvet texture melted into our skin and blended very easily. And though there was a tiny bit of sunscreen that transferred onto the black T-shirt during our testing, the majority of it remained on our skin and not the dark fabric. In any case, this is an opaque formula and a little goes a long way, (which certainly makes up for the price tag).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>5 fl. oz.<strong> </strong>| <strong>Type: </strong>Chemical | <strong>SPF Rating: </strong>60</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-serum-neutrogena-invisible-daily-defense-face-serum-with-broad-spectrum-spf-60></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Serum</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Neutrogena Face Serum with SPF 60+</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Neutrogena Invisible Daily Defense Face Serum with Broad Spectrum SPF 60+" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/fjLz25pafgiT12CBV8opJsRWdYE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/neutrogena-invisible-daily-defense-face-serum-with-broad-spectrum-spf-60-2dec414d34b1457ab675cfed06444c26.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Transfer</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Opacity</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Water Resistance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Gone are the days where sunscreen existed just to protect your skin from harmful sun rays. This pick from Neutrogena does so much more, offering up the antioxidant benefits of ginger, feverfew, and vitamin E. Ideal for those who prefer a serum-like consistency to their formulas, this felt very lightweight and comfortable on our skin, which makes it good for all skin types (oily included, since it's oil-free and non-comedogenic). We experienced no transfer at all, and after a little bit of wear, we couldn't even tell that we had it on.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This formula got major points for how moisturizing it felt, and the fact that it blended easily upon first application was a plus, as well. The pump applicator and small size makes it a portable option to tote around and reapply on the go (because reapplying sunscreen is just as important as the initial application).

This protecting reef-friendly sunscreen is great for all skin types — oily and acne-prone included since it's oil-free, hypoallergenic, and non-comedogenic. We were fans of this formula because of its transfer-proof performance, both wet and dry, along with its easy blendability and absence of a white cast. Though the formula felt slightly greasy, its great performance otherwise made this factor not so much of a breaker. The Original Scent SPF 30 Sunscreen Lotion is free of oxybenzone and octinoxate, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow nocaes">Sun Bum, as a brand, is Hawaii Act 104 Reef Compliant</a>, making it a great option for your next beach vacation.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-63 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This formula has more of a liquidy consistency, which may make it messy to apply. The one thing we would change? We wish the formula was a bit thicker so that so much doesn’t come out at once — because we want to get all the use we can out of this rockstar sunscreen. All in all, for how opaque and transfer-resistant the formula is, it's well worth it to keep this on deck.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>8 fl. oz.<strong> </strong>| <strong>Type: </strong>Chemical | <strong>SPF Rating: </strong>30</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-16 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=4359 data-sizes=750px alt="Sun Bum Original Scent SPF 30 Sunscreen Lotion sitting upright on grass" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/hoyLvu0b7MuXPBAcMPBuRQGnr1E=/fit-in/1500x4359/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/sunscreen-test-sun-bum-original-scent-spf-30-lotion-jthomspon-0071.jpg-88b7d514a2784f478931bf722dff2c02.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Jhett Thompson</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=4359 data-sizes=750px alt="Person rubbing Sun Bum Original Scent SPF 30 Sunscreen Lotion into their forearm" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/Z5qX4YKBy1D1f1OJfS2zrg3CYXY=/fit-in/1500x4359/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/sunscreen-test-sun-bum-original-scent-spf-30-lotion-jthomspon-0060.jpg-fdcb7eb3f0474cc2b0625e1ed629be88.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Jhett Thompson</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-clear-bare-republic-clearscreen-sunscreen-spray-spf-50></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Clear</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Bare Republic Clearscreen Sunscreen Spray</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Bare Republic Clearscreen Sunscreen Spray SPF 50" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/RZH8et204iLgTuzMRj-_ZV9Vcn4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/BareRepublicClearscreenSunscreenSpraySPF50-512ce378ac1c46758d2ee7556acae040.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Transfer</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Opacity</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Water Resistance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1><li readability=-1><p>Its transparent formula seemed to disappear into our skin</p></li><li readability=1><p>Free of parabens, phthalates, and synthetic fragrances</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Its weightless spray never felt greasy on our skin</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Bare Republic's Clearscreen Sunscreen & Sunblock Spray is powered by vitamin E along with raspberry and goji berry extracts for full antioxidant protection. Great for those who prefer a clear, non-tinted formula, this one felt extremely comfortable and lightweight on our skin. It was also so undetectable that we ended up feeling like we didn't even have it on. The quick-absorbing formula doesn't transfer, and was definitely water-resistant —&nbsp;the water simply beaded up nicely and rolled off of our skin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-69 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One thing to note is that the spray design might not be for everyone. The nozzle was somewhat difficult to manipulate, which is something to keep in mind before picking out your go-to spray. However, we can’t dock too many points for this, as we liked the feel and the smell of the product too much.

The spray applicator ensures you won't miss a spot, but it's what's on the inside that really sets this pick apart from the others. It's formulated with a skin-revitalizing blend of algae extract (to moisturize and soften), aloe vera extract (to soothe sunburns), and strawberry fruit extract (to fend away environmental damage).&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-75 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In terms of how well this was applied, the Coola spray scored well across all categories. It was pleasantly lightweight and refreshing when we sprayed it on our skin, and it blended beautifully once we were done spritzing. It is worth noting how effective this formula was when it came to the transfer test, never leaving white streaks on our black clothes, whether wet or dry. Not to mention its piña colada scent mentally whisks us away to white-sand beaches. How's that for a modern-day sunscreen?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-76 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>6 fl. oz.<strong> </strong>| <strong>Type: </strong>Chemical | <strong>SPF Rating: </strong>30</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-scented-bare-republic-mineral-sunscreen-body-lotion-spf-50></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Scented</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Bare Republic Sunscreen Body Lotion SPF 50</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Bare Republic Mineral Sunscreen Body Lotion SPF 50, Vanilla Coco" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/bYRm7gF-I3xM0yV1M6mRE7GvZb0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/BareRepublicMineralSunscreenBodyLotionSPF50VanillaCoco-00adeab0e5c54cc7b3598716a10e6a10.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Transfer</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>1</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Opacity</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Water Resistance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>This formula didn’t leave us with a white cast</p></li><li readability=-1><p>The fragrance is a pleasant coconut concoction that doesn’t feel overpowering</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It never felt sticky after applying</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-81 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Foul-scented sunscreens? Don't know her. This one from Bare Republic proves you can have both protection and a pleasant smell in one insanely good formula. Its lightweight vanilla and coconut fragrance is very mild, serving as a light aroma rather than a stark perfume. But this doesn't just have a pretty scent — it applied beautifully, almost like a thin lotion, and absorbed into our skin easily. We think this one would be a great option if you're applying on a whim and don't have the time to spend blending.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-82 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With all there is to love about this formula, one test it didn't pass is the transfer test. When rubbing a black T-shirt onto the skin, we noticed a bit of transfer onto the t-shirt when dried (and a lot of transfer when wet), which is something to keep in mind for your day-to-day summer activities. For this reason, we recommend saving this sunscreen for days you won't be fully clothed (for instance, at the beach or pool).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-83 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>5 fl. oz.<strong> </strong>| <strong>Type: </strong>Mineral | <strong>SPF Rating: </strong>50</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-23 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=3564 data-sizes=750px alt="Bare Republic Mineral Sunscreen Lotion sitting upright in sand" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/8FapYYSJm4zBW-7jhnnv9vGpNjY=/fit-in/1500x3564/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/PEO-bare-republic-sport-mineral-sunscreen-and-sunblock-body-lotion-with-zinc-oxide-spf-50-vanilla-coco-jhett-0065.jpg-72962337e8f843e8b9332c0feb41509b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>PEOPLE / Jhett Thompson</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=2666 data-sizes=750px alt="Person rubbing Bare Republic Mineral Sunscreen Body Lotion SPF 50 into their arm" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/awcsuNziVO4bDmi9bznPMtjxxGI=/fit-in/1500x2666/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/suncreen-test-bare-republic-sport-mineral-sunblock-body-lotion-zinc-oxide-spf-50-vanilla-coco-jthompson-0101-34a62c82fdad472f92ca7d0e9c768409.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Jhett Thompson</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-acne-prone-skin-eltamd-uv-clear-broad-spectrum-spf-46></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Acne-Prone Skin</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>EltaMD UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="EltaMD UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/_Ur4NyTkhttmPhesgDuxK8_GxtE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/EltaMDUVClearBroad-SpectrumSPF46-59408b5c1302456ab8a8046085840f48.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Dermstore</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Transfer</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Opacity</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Water Resistance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=-1><p>The pump applicator made this one easy to apply</p></li><li readability=-1><p>We appreciated its oil-free formula for extra protection against clogged pores</p></li><li readability=0><p>It's lightweight and noncomedogenic, which is great for acne-prone skin</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-88 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you're struggling to find a sunscreen that'll play nice with acne, hyperpigmentation, or rosacea, you've met your match in EltaMD's Facial Sunscreen SPF 46. This lightweight cream is enriched with niacinamide, an anti-inflammatory that helps calm redness, as well as hyaluronic acid to plump your skin and smooth out the look of fine lines and wrinkles. We fell in love with the consistency of this formula, appreciating how lightweight and non-greasy it felt while also being easily blendable. Oh, and did we mention that it didn’t transfer at all, and dried down to feel like absolutely nothing on our skin? We were impressed, to say the least. &nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-89 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We also appreciated that this formula goes on clear and doesn't leave behind a cast, making it great for all skin tones. But if you want to enhance your natural tone, you can opt for the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">tinted version</a>, too (no difference between these products, just an extra dose of pigment). It's also free of parabens, fragrance, and oils, plus it's non-comedogenic and won't clog pores. Though it's pricey, these factors may make this worth the splurge for someone who needs a little reassurance that their sunscreen won't irritate their skin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-90 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>1.7 fl. oz.<strong> </strong>| <strong>Type: </strong>Mineral | <strong>SPF Rating: </strong>46</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-25 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=2488 data-sizes=750px alt="Bottle of EltaMD UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46 sitting upright in sand" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/Y9ns7ofChFpJ6wxWHcnmZAOX1ZI=/fit-in/1500x2488/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/PEO-eltamd-facial-sunscreen-spf-46-jhett-0104-41e22d14816146899eba062cfa6d35fb.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Jhett Thompson</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=4359 data-sizes=750px alt="Person putting a dollop of EltaMD UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46 on their forearm" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/SXFeFGZgbTutH3XOeM3UzpcfjGw=/fit-in/1500x4359/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/sunscreen-test-eltamd-facial-spf-46-jthomspon-0059.jpg-405ffd9d32dc422db59b9a79eb7fdadb.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Jhett Thompson</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-lightweight-glossier-invisible-shield-spf-35></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Lightweight</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Glossier Invisible Shield SPF 35</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Sephora Glossier Invisible Shield SPF 35" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/psfmzpLjA4fielBuGt9yP1jfG48=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/glossier-invisible-shield-spf-35-97d33dd36f7c4df8962a548c0fa6cc74.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Transfer</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Opacity</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Removal</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=-1><p>Its water-gel consistency blends in easily</p></li><li readability=-1><p>The lightweight formula leaves a weightless feel behind</p></li><li readability=0><p>Its has a non-offensive, delicate citrus scent</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-95 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Glossier describes this product as "the sunscreen for people who hate wearing sunscreen," and we can certainly attest to this. Its extremely lightweight formula has an almost water-like consistency that blends in seconds, making this an easy choice for people who want to layer SPF under their makeup (as we all should). If you're not in the market for a thicker sunscreen formula, this one certainly fits the bill, as it feels more like a serum and less like sunscreen.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-96 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Though the brand doesn't make any claims on water-resistance, the formula scored high in this area. It didn't transfer before or after the water spray test — instead, the water sat on top of our testers’ skin and didn’t get past the sunscreen barrier. The application process was also something to write home about: Despite the sunscreen’s milky hues, it blended with little to no effort into our testers’ several varying skin tones. We also loved the product's light citrus fragrance, which only enhanced the experience and never smelled overpowering. Scoop this up if you're looking for a non-greasy texture that feels (and looks) invisible on the skin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-97 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>1 fl. oz.<strong> </strong>| <strong>Type: </strong>Chemical | <strong>SPF Rating: </strong>35</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-27 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=2313 data-sizes=750px alt="Glossier Invisible Shield sitting upright in sand" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/VwiinCY1CAQ8cL82ts6zSth2cVs=/fit-in/1500x2313/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/PEO-glossier-invisible-shield-spf-35-jhett-0117.jpg-61ff72717d4440e78e0190cc1e67d5de.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Jhett Thompson</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=4404 data-sizes=750px alt="Person dabbing Glossier Invisible Shield Daily Sunscreen on their hand" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/a-y780qxU2p7khb9vwSc-DrrGNo=/fit-in/1500x4404/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/peo-face-sunscreen-test-glossier-invisible-shield-daily-jthompson-0853-a21404dc37c84eba8c9dbaed4d90c8b5.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Jhett Thompson</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-tinted-live-tinted-hueguard-3-in-1-broad-spectrum-mineral-spf-30-primer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Tinted</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Live Tinted Hueguard Broad Spectrum Primer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt=live-tinted-hueguard-3-in-1-broad-spectrum-mineral-spf-30-primer-spf style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/ry2vy6KRy0F0mlZJRPHH3x2HSAA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/live-tinted-hueguard-3-in-1-broad-spectrum-mineral-spf-30-primer-spf-839006d9434b4985bfc8917f03584c8c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Transfer</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Opacity</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Water Resistance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=2.5><li readability=1><p>Acts as a moisturizer, primer, and sunscreen all in one</p></li><li readability=0><p>Despite being a mineral SPF, this sunscreen left no white cast</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It gets extra points for being reef-friendly</p></li><li readability=-1><p>We were left with a glowy finish after application</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-101 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For the ultimate multi-tasker, Live Tinted's Hueguard 3-in-1 Broad Spectrum Mineral SPF 30 sunscreen will have you feeling on top of the world. Not only does the mineral formula provide SPF 30 protection from both UVA and UVB rays, but it'll quickly replace your daily moisturizer (due to how hydrating it is) as well as your primer (thanks to how well it works with makeup without pilling). We appreciated how lightweight the formula felt on our skin, but noticed that it needed a bit more blending than we’d expected. Still, we experienced no transfer onto our clothes before or after the blotting test, and it didn’t run when we splashing our skin with water, either.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-102 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We noticed that the fragrance veers on the citrus side, but is generally short-lasting — a relief for those who are sensitive to scents in their products. Plus, the applicator is easy to use and throw in a bag for when you’re on the move, which adds a few extra points. One thing to note: This has an orange tint, which works on some paler skin tones, but may not work across all. But if you want a quick dose of color and protection, this one is an easy add to your beach bag.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-103 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>1.7 fl. oz.<strong> </strong>| <strong>Type: </strong>Mineral | <strong>SPF Rating: </strong>30</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-29 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=3368 data-sizes=750px alt="Live Tinted Hueguard 3-in-1 Broad Spectrum Mineral SPF 30 Primer standing upright in sand" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/2b2hDYDFduCdC_7mqzmFGazTFbg=/fit-in/1500x3368/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/PEO-live-tinted-spf-jhett-0134.jpg-479a0c0517564140870bd84e4e7e7c89.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Jhett Thompson</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=4359 data-sizes=750px alt="Person pumping Live Tinted Hueguard 3-in-1 Broad Spectrum Mineral SPF 30 Primer onto their arm" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/c3u9jZTReVkAmOKS4fJAso7VNng=/fit-in/1500x4359/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/sunscreen-test-live-tinted-spf-jthomspon-0025.jpg-6554e1286318479f964d9fa41f8e534d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Jhett Thompson</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-non-greasy-hawaiian-tropic-sheer-touch-body-serum-spf-50></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Non-Greasy</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Hawaiian Tropic Sheer Touch Body Serum SPF 50</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Hawaiian Tropic Sheer Touch Body Serum SPF 50" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/wswv8qJPee7F25aJmZ8WYowwnEE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/hawaiian-tropic-sheer-touch-body-serum-spf-50-ae6005c433634a95b7cb7df7078c60ec.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=-1><p>Its lightweight consistency blended effortlessly into our skin like a thin lotion</p></li><li readability=0><p>The coconut scent is pleasant, not harsh or chemical-like</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It left our skin with a luminous glow</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-107 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When you’re looking for an everyday sunscreen, the last thing you want is a greasy, buildup-prone formula that feels like a film on your skin. We didn’t test the Hawaiian Tropic Sheer Touch Body Serum in the lab, but we received a sample for at-home testing and fell in love. This SPF 50-loaded formula has all the protection of a sunscreen, yet the skincare benefits of a hydrating serum. The hero ingredient is hyaluronic acid, which moisturizes and adds luminosity to your skin while its broad-spectrum SPF shields you from the sun. The sunscreen came out of the tube in a white shade, but instantly smoothed out into a seamless, non-greasy (and clear) serum on our skin, doing double-time as a brightening skincare step and a protective barrier.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-108 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Another plus? It comes in an <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">SPF 30 version for your face</a>, too, and it layers beautifully underneath makeup — you always want sunscreen to come first, but never cause your foundation to slide off, which is why we praise this glowy, not greasy, formula. We were impressed by its resistance to water and dark-fabric transfer, so that just added to the list of reasons why we loved this protective serum. Our only word of warning is that it tends to leave a subtly glittery path in its wake, so expect some bronzy shimmer on your skin after application.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-109 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>3.3 oz. | <strong>Type:</strong> Chemical | <strong>SPF rating:</strong> 50</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-things-to-consider-before-buying-sunscreen></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Things to Consider Before Buying Sunscreen</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Formula<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Most dermatologists agree that the best sunscreen is the one that you're actually going to use. That being said, there are a few parameters to keep in mind when it comes to shopping for your perfect formula. When buying a sunscreen, Roberta Moradfar, aesthetics nurse practitioner and founder of Effacé Aesthetics, says that you should primarily consider whether you're oily, dry, combination, sensitive, or acne-prone, as more often than not, people are using the wrong formula for their skin type. Which brings us to our next point...</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There are two formula types to consider: mineral and chemical. Mineral sunscreens, also referred to as physical sunscreens, rely on zinc oxide and/or titanium dioxide to protect the skin. "Mineral sunscreens deflect UV rays, sit on the outer surface of the skin, and are effective immediately after applying them," says Dr. Elizabeth&nbsp;Hale,&nbsp;board-certified dermatologist. Chemical sunscreens, on the other hand, usually contain a combination of ingredients like octisalate, octocrylene, oxybenzone, octinoxate, and homosalate. And if you have sensitive skin, mineral sunscreens are less likely to create a reaction (the same goes for those who have skin conditions such as acne, rosacea, and melasma).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">On the other hand, "Chemical sunscreens absorb UV rays, creating a chemical reaction that transforms the UV rays into heat, which ultimately gets released from the skin," explains Moradfar. Also, chemical sunscreens must be applied at least 30 minutes prior to any sun exposure, Dr. Hale notes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In addition to the difference in ingredients used, there's also a difference in how the two forms of sunscreen apply. Because mineral sunscreens physically block off UV rays, they tend to sit on the surface of the skin and may feel heavier than their chemical counterparts. Chemical sunscreens tend to blend and absorb easier into the skin, notes Hale. That being said, mineral sunscreens have come a long way. While mineral sunscreens of the past were known to leave a white cast, modern-day formulas blend easier and are much more lightweight.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Pricing<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Sunscreens vary greatly when it comes to pricing, with some options costing a few dollars and others costing near the triple digit mark. You should be wearing sunscreen all day, year-round, rain or shine, so if you plan on switching from chemical to mineral depending on the season, consider how long your sunscreen will last and if it's worth it to invest in a higher-end product if you'll only get one season's worth. Our favorite budget-friendly sunscreen is the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Banana Boat Light as Air </a>sunscreen, which was comparable to many of the more expensive sunscreens we tested.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Expiration Dates<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Just like your other beauty products, it's important to look at the expiration dates of your sunscreen. But rather than risking bacteria growth like you'll find in expired makeup or skincare, an expired sunscreen means a decrease in the level of protection you're getting. "Typically, sunscreens are good for about two years, but we know they degrade faster if they are left in sunlight or in a hot environment," warns Hale. "It's important to keep them in a cool area or medicine cabinet, but if they are left in a hot place, I'd toss them sooner." Some key indicators of your sunscreen being expired are a watery or chunky consistency, foul smell, and oxidation, says Moradfar.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>PEOPLE / Jhett Thompson</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-we-tested></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How We Tested</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our PEOPLE Tested team tried out 52 sunscreens. For each of them, we looked at feel, transfer, opacity, and water-resistance, eventually narrowing it down to 15 that stood out from the rest. To start, we applied one teaspoon of sunscreen to either our arm or leg and rubbed it in.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As we were applying, we considered the texture of the product, how well it blended, if it felt tacky or chalky, and the color. After blending, we let the sunscreen sit on our skin for 15 minutes, paying close attention to how well it absorbed into the skin and if any irritation occurred. To test the product's transfer, the we touched a black T-shirt onto our skin, taking note of whether or not the sunscreen rubbed off on the T-shirt or if it remained intact on the skin. They we sprayed our arm or leg that had the sunscreen on it with a spritz bottle filled with water to test whether the sunscreen ran or stayed in place, and whether it took on a sticky, slippery feel when coming in contact with water. In the end, 15 sunscreens reigned supreme, with different formulas being better for specific skin types, preferences, and lifestyles.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-faq-644a3a9d-221d-4bb3-b2b1-615a1a030aff></span><p>Frequently Asked Questions</p><ul id=mntl-sc-block-faq__content_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-faq__content mntl-accordion" readability=49.543746645196><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>What sunscreen is best for everyday use?</span></p><p>Sunscreen should be bought and worn year-round — the question is, what type of sunscreen should you wear during what season. "The advantage to chemical sunscreens is that they increase sweat- and water-resistance, which is great in the summer when you're outdoors more and participating in physical activities," says Hale, who also points out chemical sunscreen's ability to prevent sun burns by blocking UVB rays. During the colder months, you're less worried about sun burns and more worried about preventing signs of aging and hyperpigmentation, making mineral sunscreens better for this time of year. So, with the recommendation of Dr. Hale, opt for a physical sunscreen year-round and a chemical sunscreen during the summer when you're more active and spending more time outdoors.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>What sunscreen do dermatologists recommend?</span></p><p>"The best sunscreen is the one you will actually use," says Dr. Hale. "I'm thrilled that there are so many types of sunscreens and formulations available, but you have to use one you'll apply regularly." A general rule of thumb, Dr. Hale notes, is to apply a base coat of sunscreen first. For this, she typically recommends using a lotion. For reapplying, other formulations — such as chemical sunscreen sprays or mineral sunscreen powders — are very helpful, she says.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-0.96705426356589><p><span class=accordion__title>Which is the best sunscreen for your face?</span></p><p>"For the face, I recommend using mineral-based products because they provide broad-spectrum protection and block both UVA and UVB rays," says Hale. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Sunscreen powders</a> are a good option if you have oily skin — not only are they easy to reapply throughout the day (which you should be doing with your sunscreen anyway), but they'll also help absorb any excess oil on your skin.
