Rose, 33, was hard to miss in a stunning pink-and-red silk dress that accentuated her curves. Khalifa, 29, kept his look a little more subdued with an unbuttoned white dress shirt and black suit.</p><p>The pair, who split in September 2014 after a little over a year of marriage, stood in the middle of the Beverly Hilton ballroom chatting closely at one point, and the makeup maven kept one arm around the rapper’s waist.</p><p>Later, when Bell Biv DeVoe kicked off the night with a rousing rendition of their 1990 hit “Poison,” Khalifa was the one with his arms wrapped around Rose’s waist from behind as she danced and sang along. They continued to sway together through <b>Mary J. Blige</b>’s two-song set.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p><span>The couple’s reunion comes hot on the heels of news that Rose and her beau of five months, </span><b><a href=#>Val Chmerkovskiy</a></b><span>, are no more.</span></p><p>A source told <i>Us</i> that the reason she and the <i>Dancing With the Stars</i> pro <a href=#>split up was that “they’re just too different.”</a> Added another insider, “Val has been on tour and really hasn’t had time to see her too much. It fizzled out, but it wasn’t serious to begin with. I could see them hooking up again in the future.”</p><p>Rose and Chmerkovskiy, 30, started dating after meeting on season 23 of the show, where Rose was paired with Val’s older brother <b><a href=#>Maksim</a></b>. Though the exes first played coy with their relationship status, they went Instagram official on December 12 with sultry images of the two of them kissing.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaapZKav26%2BzqycZpmemXqmxIywoLNlm52urbXFmmShp5yZeqmtzZ2qZqOZqMBurdNmp6udXZy%2FornMsqpmmpGotW7Dk29tbWtjZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
