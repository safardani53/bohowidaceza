And no, they don’t think that <a href=#>Tyga’s the real father</a>.</p><p>They think that <a href=#>precious baby&nbsp;Stormi</a> looks just like Kylie’s unnecessarily handsome bodyguard. Take a look.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg></p><p>Kylie has been enjoying herself with Travis Scott and sweet baby Stormi&nbsp;in Turks and Caicos this week.</p><p>But as she shared more photos of her adorable three-month-old baby, some fans and followers noticed that … Stormi is not quite the spitting image of Travis.</p><p>On its own, that wasn’t much. Some children take after one parent more than the other.</p><p>But then someone on Twitter came out and asked the question:</p><p>"Why does Stormi Jenner look like Kylie’s bodyguard?"</p><p>Oh.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Kylie’s unnecessarily attractive bodyguard is a man named Tim Chung.</p><p>In addition to working as her bodyguard, he is also an officer with the LAPD.</p><p>(A lot of bodyguards and other private security workers are current or former police; the security industry pays better)</p><p>On top of that, as you may have guessed from looking at his photos, Tim is a part-time model.</p><p>While we are certainly not going to accuse Tim or Kylie of doing anything improper, there were quite a few people on Twitter who felt no such reservations.</p><p>Looking at the faces of Tim and Stormi, they decided that he is Kylie’s baby daddy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>The theory did a bit of circulating, and more and more people jumped on board.</p><p>"I’ve never been more convinced by a theory!! Kylie Jenner’s baby. Is the bodyguards baby. Kris is up to something."</p><p>We have to wonder what scheme of Kris’ would involve her daughter’s pregnancy being attributed to a guy she’d only been dating for a few weeks.</p><p>"I wouldn’t blame Kylie if her bodyguard the real daddy. I’d let him impregnate me too."</p><p>That, as we’ll discuss later, may be on the minds of a lot of the people who are buying into this.</p><p>One person claims that Kylie is aware of this theory … and is blocking anyone who asks her about it.</p><p>"Okay so Kylie Jenner just blocked me cuz i asked her why does her baby look like her bodyguard…"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Under this, Tim Chung’s latest Instagram photo, fans could not resist commenting on the story.</p><p>"Sw stormi’s dad just chillin nice."</p><p>A lot of them seemed to be taking it for granted that this wild theory is accurate. Or perhaps simply hoping to provoke a reaction.</p><p>"The look you give when the world realized you stormis daddy."</p><p>Others straight-up asked.</p><p>"Heey are you the father of stormi."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>One person either was asking him the question very succinctly … or was asking what other commenters were talking about.</p><p>"Stormi’s dad??"</p><p>Then someone else had a very different question.</p><p>"Can you be my dad?"</p><p>Note that we don’t think that this person is looking for, um, parental love.</p><p>"You wanna be my baby daddy too??"</p><p>Yeah. There was a lot of that. One wonders where the line between admiration and sexual harassment of someone’s bodyguard is drawn.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>It is so important that we note a few things.</p><p>One, Stormi is an interracial baby. Children whose parents have massively different skin tones can bear a strong resemblance to one parent or the other. It doesn’t mean that anyone cheated.</p><p>Two, Tim Chung is one hot dude. We have to wonder how many people who buy this theory are just looking at him and thinking "wow, if I were Kylie …" when Kylie seldom does what most people would consider sensible.</p><p>Three, now that it’s been nearly a month since the world learned that Tristan Thompson is a no good dirty cheater, there hasn’t been any fresh&nbsp;Kardashian drama. No, Kanye spouting nonsense doesn’t count.</p><p>Some fans may simply be bored of watching Kylie settle into the peaceful life of motherhood, well on her way to becoming a billionaire, and want to see her life be interesting again.</p><p>Don’t worry, folks. Real drama will come on its own, naturally. It always does with that family.</p><p>In the mean time, rumors like this could ruin this guy’s career.</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>Stormi Webster: See ALL Her Precious Pics!</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pwX2WCcLfYpaCeZZqau6%2Bx0WagrGWYmr9utNSnorJlkqSxurPUmqmdZZiav26%2BxJqjZpqRl8ZusMCdm7Jn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
