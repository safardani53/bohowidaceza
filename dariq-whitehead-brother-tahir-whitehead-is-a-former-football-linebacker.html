He also has an older sister, Janavia, and a younger brother, Asher.</p><p>The projected first-round pick, Dariq, will stand alongside <a href=# rel=noopener>Victor Wembanyama</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>Brandon Miller</a> at the 2023 NBA Draft ceremony.

But one injury changed his career path.</p><p>Quaheem was a father figure to his brothers and was the one to motivate Tahir to play football. And though he returned from injury, Quaheem never really returned to his older self on the field.</p><p>Though Quaheem received a scholarship froDelawarere State, he decided to drop out. But the street life caught Quaheem. He has previously been arrested for weapons and drug charges.&nbsp;</p><p>In an <a href=# rel=noopener>interview</a> in 2013, Quaheem talked about how different his life was from his little brother, Tahir. A man who always protected his brother, Quaheem continued to live in Newark when his brother was living in the suburb of Detroit.&nbsp;</p><h2>Dariq Whitehead, And His Mom, Quadira Whitehead&nbsp;</h2><p>Dariq Whitehead was raised in Newark, New Jersey, singlehandedly by his mother.

In an interview with <a href=#>Ebony</a>, Quadira first became pregnant at just 14, then at 16, and then at 18.&nbsp;</p><p>The odds were stacked against her kids to go out and achieve big in their lives, but Tahir still made it to the NFL, and now Dariq looks set to play in the NBA.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/dariq-whitehead-mother.jpg><p>In her interview, Quadira said it’s important as a parent to strike the right balance between understanding their wants. She taught her kids to face every adversity with a smile on their faces and pushed them to achieve their dreams.&nbsp;</p><p>Previously, Quadira worked as a teacher’s aide with underprivileged kids and had to rely on the government’s assistance to feed her kids. The Whitehead family has certainly come far from those humble days.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunCwwKugqmWnnba1sceemJ1lkqe8tbTEq2StmZiev27Dx6KrnqCVlrFutdJmmGaen6e6pr6Mn6aorJKWua15y6KlnpqRmLimvo4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
