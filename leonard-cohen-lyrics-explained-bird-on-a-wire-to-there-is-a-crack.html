It is believed to another reference to his love for Marianne.</p><h2>Surely 'Famous Blue Raincoat' can't be about a coat?</h2><p>Kind of.</p><p>Sometime in the early 1970s, a thief stole Cohen's old raincoat from Marianne's &nbsp;apartment.</p><p>It was that very coat that inspired Cohen to write one of his most beloved and mysterious songs.</p><p>It's written in the form of a letter, possibly to the narrator's brother, who stole his lover.</p><br><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><p><a href=#>Celebrity deaths in 2016 – from Leonard Cohen to David Bowie, all the stars we’ve lost this year</a></p><p><a href=#>Tragic Pete Burns chillingly describes his near-death experience in the last interview</a></p><p><a href=#>X Factor finalist signs first record deal …eight years after being booted from show</a></p><p><a href=#>The X Factor star Honey G forced to boost her security after gang shooting hoax</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZ353f5Ftb2iklaS7or7DZpqooJWjeq3F0aKarGWVrb2trcinnJ1lkp6%2FpXnOp2SaZaeev6Z506hkraCVp7JutdJmmGabopawrHs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
