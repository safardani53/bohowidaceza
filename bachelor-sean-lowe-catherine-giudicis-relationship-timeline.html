He was branded as the “Virgin Bachelor,” as he had revealed that he was a born-again virgin and was saving himself for marriage.</p><p>Giudici, for her part, didn’t know what to expect when she joined the dating show, but she quickly fell in love. The pair tied the knot in 2014 and went on to welcome three kids.</p><p>Lowe’s Bachelor journey initially aired in 2013. Seven years later, it was featured as part of The Bachelor: The Greatest Seasons — Ever, a spinoff looking back at 10 seasons from the franchise.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“When I was originally cast, I was very flattered but somewhat grounded by the fact that I would be one of the faces that represented people of color. I knew that one of the reasons I was probably chosen was because I was Filipino,” Giudici wrote via Instagram in June 2020. “I counted myself out to be his fiancée because of what I assumed Sean liked.<a href=#> I thought I was there just to check a box</a>, but I ended up with so much more. I became present with the process and as he started noticing me for who I really was, I allowed this experience to open myself up to the possibility of being fully loved and appreciated for all that I was. I ended up getting to represent a mixed race community, I found Christ (I LOVE my testimony!) and marrying the most amazing man I’ve ever known. I’d say doing this show was one of the best things that ever happened to me.”</p><p>Scroll through the gallery below for a full timeline of Lowe and Giudici’s relationship.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkr6Kvx56jqKpdqLKiuoylprCdXZiutbTEq6CnnV2ctrawyJygrGWimrmiwMiopaygmaV6tbXMnqOippVk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
