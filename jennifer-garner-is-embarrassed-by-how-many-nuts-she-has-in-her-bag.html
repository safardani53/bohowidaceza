For <a href=#><strong>Jennifer Garner</strong></a>, the limit does not exist!</p><p>“What’s in my bag? I’m embarrassed to even show you …. 🥜🌰🥜🐿️,” Garner, 51, <a href=# rel=noopener>teased via Instagram</a> on Saturday, November 25. The actress proceeded to pull everything out of her backpack for her followers to see.</p><p>The contents started out normal enough, with a notebook, glasses case and “a little pouch of pens because pens are life.”</p><p>However, <a href=#>the Family Switch actress</a> quickly learned that like a squirrel she hoards nuts — and candy — for the winter.</p><p>“A little tiny bag of nuts,” she said while pulling a plastic bag out of her carry-all. “I’m gonna keep these … just kidding.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Jennifer-Garner-Is-Embarrassed-by-How-Many-Pouches-of-Nuts-She-Has-in-Her-Bag-3.jpg><p>Garner was then surprised to see that she had another plastic bag of nuts and multiple prepackaged varieties of the food item, including two pistachio snacks, in her bag as well. “Nuts. Nuts. Nuts. Nuts,” she said as one by one she unveiled another bag.</p><p>The <a href=#>13 Going on 30</a> star broke into laughter and started to cry as she kept finding more nuts. “I’m so scared I’m not going to have any nuts,” she joked through her tears, revealing that she counted eight bags in total.</p><p>Garner’s second biggest bag revelation was that she had both empty and full bags of candies hidden deep in her backpack. “Gotta have your candy handy,” she joked after finding two bags of the same brand.</p><p>While Garner also carried two books and an iPad, it was her food choices that caught the attention of her fans and friends.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Jennifer-Garner-Is-Embarrassed-by-How-Many-Pouches-of-Nuts-She-Has-in-Her-Bag-2.jpg><p>“You are adorable ❤️,” <strong>Courteney Cox</strong> replied in the comments, while <strong>Mindy Kaling</strong> agreed, “Pens are LIFE.”</p><p><a href=#><strong>Reese Witherspoon</strong></a>, meanwhile, wrote what many of Garner’s followers were thinking, commenting, “So many nuts!! Are you a squirrel? 🤣.”&nbsp; One fan went as far as to call Garner “the Mary Poppins of nuts.”</p><p>Earlier this year, Garner gave fans an inside look at what she eats in a day while chatting with <a href=# rel=noopener>Harper’s Bazaar</a>.</p><p>“My regular breakfast is coffee and more coffee,” she revealed in April. “Usually, these days, I’ll have one breakfast that I get really fixated on for a few years. Right now, it is a full-fat yogurt and berries and nuts.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Garner joked that while she does “not have the gift of making anything cute” she does “<a href=#>like to cook and bake</a> for people [she] loves.”</p><p>While Garner keeps her and ex-husband <strong>Ben Affleck</strong>’s three kids — Violet, 17, Seraphina, 14, and Samuel, 11 — out of the limelight, she doesn’t shy away from <a href=#>sharing what she cooks</a> for them via social media. In fact, she often shares her failures and successes with her followers, including Easter bunny bread and cinnamon bread men.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmn6efmXyvsdasZqOdnqO2p7HRZp6aqp6av2610macppqRp7%2Biv9Kem2aaqWK1sMOMppinsV2jwrW%2FjKyfnmWYlsButc1mn56qXZeuqHs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
