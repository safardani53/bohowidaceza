Two years more in a brace. Then I’m about finished.</p><p>“Between the first operation this year and the second one, there has to be a minimum of one year.</p><p>“It’s because my upper jaw is a lot smaller than my lower jaw. My underbite is over a centimetre.</p><p>“Even a slice of ham, I cannot even bite properly.
