Worry is a waste of time, I’m ok."</p><p>I always took what you said to heart. Probably because everything you said was so smart.</p><p>Every time you came home from tour you spent all your hours with us. No matter how tired you were, how many time zones you traveled, you were there for us.</p><p>Whenever I was sick you would take care of me. You would cuddle with me, hug me, kiss me. You didn’t care about getting sick. You would stay up all night to make sure my fever went down</p><p>And if it didn’t, you would wake me up and give me my medicine. I would open my eyes, see you, and feel better.</p><p>I have so many memories with you but one of my favorite ones was earlier this year when I was jetlagged and we watched ‘Purple Rain ‘. We were staying at the BHH and you came into my room when I was trying to find a movie to watch.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/chris-cornell-on-guitar-902x1024.jpg><p>“How about Purple Rain?” you said. I always trusted your judgement. I put it on and immediately fell in love! We then got to your favorite song, ‘The Beautiful Ones’.</p><p>“This song is so special it doesn’t even belong in a genre. When I was in my twenties, I saw this in the theatre and some guy started cracking up laughing at this scene and song. It got me really mad, ” you said.</p><p>I fell in love with the song too and listened to it on repeat.</p><p>Our special connection was always the arts. Poems, books, music, writing. We both have a unconditional love for it.</p><p>Who’s going to introduce me to movies like ‘Purple Rain’ and songs like ‘The Beautiful Ones’ now? I’m hoping I will find some because you trained me so well.</p><p>I know you are still here, and the warmth I feel beneath the cold, is you.</p><p>YOU ARE THE BEST FATHER IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD.</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>26 Stars Who Committed Suicide</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><p>And I know, that if this wasn’t an accident, you’d still be cuddling with me watching ‘Purple Rain’.</p><p>I love you and miss you so, Daddy.
