"It really took him a long time to get over her. He really loved her a lot."</p><p>Sings Mayer in the song: ""You find yourself alone. . .

Ultimately he's done a lot of self reflection though and it he realizes they weren't right for each other."</p><p>The rocker and the Horrible Bosses actress first got together in April 2008 and, after multiple breakups, called it quits for good in late 2009. Aniston has been happily ensconced with Justin Theroux for over a year now.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"[John and Jen] weren't right for each other, but he is really a good guy."</p><p>After high-profile flameouts both Simpson, 31, and then Aniston, Mayer is done dating celebs, the source adds.
