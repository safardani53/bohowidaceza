Get an ambulance.’ ”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>He also said that Jose “had already pushed the panic button that was in the doorman’s booth, and that just overwhelms the outgoing line with a constant message to the police, pre-recorded.” In an attempt to make sure to get the police’s attention, Jay called 911 from the Dakota building.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After Jose then told him that John’s shooter was still outside and unarmed, he “grabbed the billy club on top of the safe” and went “down the stairs, because I was going to clock this guy, because I was afraid he was going to get away.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As he approached Chapman, Jay admitted he noticed he was “facing the wall, doing something . . . He was reading a book.” When police arrived a short time later, they initially thought Jay was the culprit. “I looked a little crazy, I already had blood on my hands, I just had my shirt on, my white shirt with no tie,” he said. He made sure to point police to Chapman, who was then arrested and eventually sentenced to 20 years-to-life for shooting and killing John.</p><p class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">John was 40-years-old at the time of his death. The talented musician left behind his wife, Yoko, and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>their son, <strong>Sean Lennon</strong></a>, who was five-years-old at the time of his passing, as well as his oldest son, <strong>Julian Lennon</strong>, who was 17.
