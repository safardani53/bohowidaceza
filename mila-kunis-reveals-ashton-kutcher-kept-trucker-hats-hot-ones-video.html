You didn’t get rid of anything. You have plenty of trucker hats, and the entire ’70s wardrobe is downstairs. What is this?” Ashton, who did not appear on the virtual appearance, could be heard laughing as he replied,&nbsp;“Who are you talking to?” Mila then quipped, “Lies. Lies.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/mila-kunis-ashton-kutcher-SS-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>In the era of Juicy Couture, Uggs and “Return To Tiffany” silver jewelry, Ashton arguably pioneered the trucker hat trend of the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>early ’00s</a>. The actor regularly wore them to basketball games, red carpets and out and about with a slew of sayings, including one that read “Teenage Millionaire” from clothing brand dELiA*s back in 2003. <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Paris Hilton</strong></a><span>,</span><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong> Nicole Richie</strong></a><span>, </span><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Britney Spears</strong></a><span> and other stars were also fans of hat style, primarily wearing logo styles by </span><strong>Von Dutch</strong><span>.

I had the biggest crush on him,” she hilariously added.&nbsp;The pair married in 2015, and now share two kids together: <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>daughter <strong>Wyatt</strong>, 7, and son <strong>Dimitri</strong>, 4</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH5xe5JpZqahnJZ6rMHNoqpmqpWrsqK40maYrKCkpLtut9StmqGdomK4przTZqurrZOgsrN5x5qrrGWYpMFuu82eqmaumZmysHs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
