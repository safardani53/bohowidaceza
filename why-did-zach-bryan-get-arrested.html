He’s making the trip with his beautiful dog, Jack, but it wasn’t all smooth sailing. Luckily, Zach gave us all the rundown of exactly what happened in his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram Stories</a>.</p><p>On Sept. 6, Zach was pulled over for going a few miles over the speed limit in a small Oklahoma town. The cop then asked for Zach’s license, registration, and address, but as an international superstar, Zach wasn’t comfortable giving out his address, so the officer asked Zach to step out of his vehicle and handcuffed him. But this isn’t the incident in question.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@zachlanebryan</a></figure><p>After some talking, the police officer let Zach go. The next day, however, Zach told his security guard that he wanted to drive to the East Coast to catch the Eagles vs. Patriots game, so they went on their merry way in two separate cars. As they’re driving through Oklahoma, Zach’s security guard gets pulled over.</p><p>At this point, Zach is already frustrated with the police because of his previous incident. And now, he’s on a time crunch to get to the game. So, Zach circles around and sits in his car for about 15-20 minutes, waiting for the cop to let them go on their way. But after a while, stewing in frustration, Zach gets out of his car and tries to ask what’s going on.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@zachlanebryan</a></figure><p>The cop, however, instructs Zach to get back into his car or he’ll “go to jail.” By now, Zach has let his emotions get the best of him. In his retelling, he makes it very clear that he doesn’t stand by his actions or his heightened emotions that led to him being “lippy” with the officer. As the situation played out, Zach and the officer grew more frustrated, so the officer booked him into the Craig County Jail at 6:42 p.m. for “obstruction of investigation.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">After he was arrested, Zach posted bail, apologized for his actions, and continued on his road trip.</h2><p>Although he spent about an hour and a half in jail, Zach was able to quickly post bail and continue on his journey. He said that when he left, he shook the officer’s hand and apologized for how he reacted to the situation. Almost immediately, Zach also released a statement on Twitter to get ahead of the news. “Today I had an incident with the Oklahoma Highway Patrol. Emotions got the best of me and I was out of line in the things I said,” he wrote.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Today I had an incident with the Oklahoma Highway Patrol.

They brought me to jail, and there is a mug shot of me floating around. Prayers we can all move on from this and prayers people know I’m just trying the best I can, I love you guys and I am truly sorry to the officers.”</p><p>Despite Zach’s apologies, his fans have run to his defense. Some are even encouraging him to make the mugshot his next album cover. But at least now we know the full story and can make our own judgment call about who was really in the wrong.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOim2aykZi1bq7RspinZZeawW6t0aucrKyVmQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
