Even though his wife <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Gisele Bundchen</strong></a> is the supermodel in the family, Tom seriously gave her a run for her money.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/tom-brady-swim-collection-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>In the ads, Tom posed in a tiny blue swimsuit while looking off into the distance as his body was toned, and tanned. Meanwhile, in another photo, Tom posed by the pool in a pair of light gray shorts with black drawstrings. The shorts were a bit longer than the blue ones and he styled the bottoms with a matching button-down shirt.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/tom-brady-swim-collection-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>In the photo by the pool, Tom kept his collared shirt unbuttoned, showing off his bare chest while on his cellphone. He posted that photo to his Instagram with the caption, “Hate when you’re hanging by the pool in your matching set and they call to go over the fitness test at training camp…”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Tom also posted a photo of him in the water modeling with the caption, “Locker room is gonna love this one..” with a laughing crying emoji at the end.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/tom-brady-swim-collection-embed3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>This is the first time Tom’s brand, BRADY, has released a swim category featuring a slew of Swim Shorts that are made with soft mesh lining, shake-to-dry technology, and zero water retention.
