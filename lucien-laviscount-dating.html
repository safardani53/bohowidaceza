Last season, Emily in Paris introduced Lucien Laviscount, who plays Alfie, a British banker who becomes part of Emily's romantic entanglements.</p><p>And while we already know that Emily and Alfie hit it off on the show (wink wink), what is Lucien's love life like off camera? Here's everything we know.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is Lucien Laviscount single?</h2><p>Lucien appears to currently be single. The 30-year-old British actor has seemingly never married, and based on his scattered dating history, it looks like he hasn't really ever had a long-term partner either.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who has Lucien Laviscount dated?</h2><p>Lucien is quite a catch if you ask us! And although he doesn't share too much about his personal life on social media, we were able to dig up some info on his former lovers.</p><p>Lucien <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reportedly dated</a> Big Brother winner <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sophie Reade</a> in 2010 and was linked a year later to his Waterloo Road co-star <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chelsea Healey</a>. Lucien was also spotted on a dinner date with Little Mix member <a href=#>Leigh-Anne Pinnock</a> in 2012. The following year, he was also rumored to be dating actress <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brooke Vincent</a>.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Furthermore, Lucien was also romantically linked to his Scream Queens co-star <a href=#>Keke Palmer</a> in 2015. And the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Mail</a> spotted Lucien holding hands with <a href=#>Kelly Osborne</a> in 2019. More recently, Lucien has been linked to a slew of other women. And in November 2021, Lucien was linked to <a href=#>Jesy Nelson</a>, another (former) member of <a href=#>Little Mix</a>. The two were spotted snuggling up against one another in a rickshaw in London.</p><p>A source later told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sun</a> that Jesy was in fact single and that the two weren't kissing in the photos, despite what it may have looked like. “They’re not boyfriend and girlfriend — they just ran into each other on a night out,” the source declared.</p><p>Even more recently, Lucien has been linked to three other potential romantic partners. He attended the British Fashion Awards and was seen linking arms with both <a href=#>Wallis Day of Batwoman</a> and singer-songwriter <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Arlissa</a> at the event.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>At the same event, Lucien was also seen holding hands with former Game of Thrones star <a href=#>Hannah John-Kamen</a>. It seems that Lucien's real-life romantic entanglements may be even more complicated than those of the character he plays on Emily in Paris.</p><p>Emily in Paris Seasons 1, 2, and 3 are now streaming on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfocKktcSnZKWZpp7ApLvUp6tmnJGptq%2Bz</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
