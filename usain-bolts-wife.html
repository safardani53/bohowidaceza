Details of her growing up have not been revealed yet.</p><h2>Usain Bolt’s Wife | Education</h2><p>Usain Bolt’s wife has not been very open about her personal life and the same goes for her educational life.</p><p>She graduated from high school attending a school in her hometown, Old Harbour.</p><p>Moreover, Kasi studied Bachelor of Laws in her college, and following that, she got herself a postgraduate business degree in Master of Business and Management.</p><p>Other than that, any information regarding her educational background has not been publicly disclosed.</p><h2>Usain Bolt’s wife | Professional Career</h2><p>In 2016, <a href=#>Usain Bolt</a> made his relationship with Kasi public.</p><p>He shared a photo of him with Kasi, captioned “The president and the first lady.” After the sudden announcement, fans and followers went crazy over <a href=#>Usain Bolt</a>‘s partner they had not seen before.</p><p>Kasi Bennett’s social media accounts grew multiple folds overnight, making her a hot topic overnight.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/59797429_130877861428252_833227346231320824_n-e1633252271887.jpg><p>People loved her immediately, firstly, for being <a href=#>Usain Bolt</a>‘s significant other, secondly, for having an impressive physique.</p><p>Just through a single post, Kasi became a social media star and a celebrity.</p><p>She used this popularity for good. She started upgrading her modeling career and got involved in different ways to provide for the needy in Jamaica.</p><p>Kasi founded a non-profit organization named Project Kase, specializing in providing educational support for the less fortunate.</p><p>Besides that, Kasi also has her hands wet in the field of marketing. She is the Managing Director for a marketing and business development agency named ‘Elevate Marketing House.’</p><h3>Kasi’s Modeling Career</h3><p>Mrs. fastest man in the universe is a self-proclaimed fashionista.</p><p>Kasi really loves to posts pictures of herself in different dresses and fashion accessories. She has been a fashionista since her late teens.</p><p>She has been fond of modeling and prefers to keep herself in good shape.</p><p>Much like her husband, Bennet is also a workout freak; spending time in the gym is one of her favorite things to do.</p><p>She started modeling right after graduating high school. She worked on a number of modeling projects in her initial days as a model.</p><p>Kasi even auditioned for different movies and T.V. shows.</p><p>At present, she is more of an ‘Instagram model’ as she poses extensively for the gram.</p><p>We prefer to be real with our readers and not sugarcoat any information. Honestly, Kasi’s career as a model is not that impressive as she has yet to make it big.</p><p>But from what we can tell, she has been focusing on providing for the needy children more than flaunting her looks and curves for the agencies and magazines.</p><p>She treated modeling more like a hobby than an actual career.</p><h2>Net Worth of Usain Bolt’s Wife</h2><p>It is estimated that Kasi has a net worth of around a million dollars, give or take a couple hundred thousand.</p><p>Our specialist also agrees with the estimation as she has over 400 thousand followers on Instagram.</p><p>We speculate that a massive chunk of her net worth comes from her ever-so-popular Instagram account.</p><p>The sponsorship deals, endorsements, and advertisement deals she gets from different brands account for a lot of money.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/20837512_1568075019881504_3084739215288696832_n-e1633252337537.jpg><p>Most influencers reply on the formula that every 10,000 followers adds up a $100 in their endorsement charges.</p><p>After some quick maths, her current endorsement charge for a single Instagram story would be somewhere around the area of $300-$400.</p><p>The charge is estimated after consideration of different factors that influence the productive effect of the story.</p><p>Similarly, Kasi’s other half, <a href=#>Usain Bolt</a>, has an estimated net worth of $90 million due to the races he won and the various endorsement deals he has made with highly established brands.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Read more about Usain Bolt’s net worth and endorsements here in this article >></strong></a></p><h2>Kasi and Usain’s relationship</h2><p>Information regarding how the couple first met each other, who took the first steps, and who confessed who is not available at the moment.</p><p>But we do have other info about their relationship.</p><p>The year 2016 proved to be a bit of a controversial period for Usain as he was seen with a Brazillian woman named Jady Duarte.</p><p>A picture of Usain and Jady got somewhat viral on the internet, but Kasi stayed calm and did not let her emotions get the best of her.</p><p>She made rational decisions and did not put her relationship in danger.</p><p>Kasi decided to stay by Usain, ignoring what people were speculating about him and Jade; she had a hundred percent trust in her boyfriend.</p><p>As a result of their never breaking trust and faith in each other, they have come a long way since then.</p><p>The couple had gone through thick and thin together. They have grown and matured to the point that they have three beautiful little kids together without needing or worrying about marriage.</p><p>The duo’s first child was born in May 2020. Her name was made public after two months of her birth.</p><p>She was named ‘Olympia Lightning Bolt’ by her mother, Kasi.</p><p>Similarly, Olympia’s twin siblings were rather on the line as the two were born on the father’s day of 2021 (June 19).</p><p>The twins were named, Saint Leo Bolt and Thunder Bolt, by their father, Usain. Such a cool name by a cool dad.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Read about Usain Bolt’s childhood, career, lifestyle, and more in the following article >></strong></a></p><h2>Marriage and more kids?</h2><p>In June of 2021, the real-life Flash claimed that he intends to be a good father and marry Kasi during an interview.</p><p>The duo has been together for six years but has yet to marry. He also said that he is getting less sleep now that he is the father of three little kids.</p><p>Likewise, Bolt also sided with raising three kids when he was asked which was the harder thing to do, running a 100 meters dash or raising three kids.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/106404258_734009180701247_2121130951911472871_n-e1633252699365.jpg><p>“When all three start crying altogether.. you don’t know what to do. It’s so difficult, but it’s so worth it,” commented Bolt.</p><p>As of now, neither Mr. Bolt nor Mrs. Bolt has spoken anything about any more children.</p><p>We speculate that even if they have one in the future, they will keep it a secret until their child’s birth as they did with the twins that were born recently.</p><p>Usain stated that Kasi just wants a peaceful pregnancy without any media running behind her trying to have a word or two.</p><p><a href=#><strong>You might be curious to read about the top 74 quotes by the great Usain Bolt >></strong></a></p><h2>Social Media Links</h2><p>Kasi Bennett has always been an active social media user as she is a social media influencer and an Instagram model. It is her job to be active on the internet.</p><p>But recently, Usain has also been on the run. He has been posting quite a lot maybe after his retirement in 2017 he has not much to spend his time doing.</p><p>It makes sense, there’s not much to do when you have been running all your life, and suddenly you have to stop doing it.</p><p>The man seems to enjoy football as he recently shared a picture of himself wearing a Manchester United scarf.</p><p>It’s funny how it’s almost guaranteed that a woman’s Instagram is mostly filled with pictures of herself and her boyfriend or husband while a man’s Insta is full of sports-related things or his fishing hobby.</p><p>The couple is no exception.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a>: 404k followers</p><h2>FAQs</h2><h3>Is Usain Bolt still with Kasi Bennett?</h3><p>Yes,<a href=#> Usain Bolt</a> and <a href=#>Kasi Bennett</a> are still together.
