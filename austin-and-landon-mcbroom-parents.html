Prior to launching his social media channel, Austin was known as a basketball player. Now, he still participates in athletics as a boxer, and has taken part in several celebrity matches inside the ring. Landon, meanwhile, also has a presence on YouTube, although he's been mired in controversy in recent months following accusations of abuse from his former girlfriend Shyla Walker.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">A restraining order has been filed against Landon McBroom.</h2><p>Landon used to run a join YouTube account with Shyla, but the couple <a href=#>stopped posting videos</a> in May of this year. Since then, reporting has come out that Shyla filed a restraining order against Landon, claiming that he had physically abused her. The reports also suggested that Landon had tried to kidnap their daughter, Souline, and the restraining order was eventually granted against Landon.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The two have continued to battle over social media, in part over how much Landon should feature their daughter in his posts. Austin has not faced any similar relationship drama, but he is involved in a <a href=#>potentially costly lawsuit </a>after it was revealed that the influencer-focused boxing event that he had helped organize failed to rake in the amount of revenue that it was supposed to.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Landon has also been accused of faking his lavish lifestyle.</h2><p>In addition to his relationship problems, which seem serious, Landon has also<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> been accused</a> of stealing other people's photos for use on his own Instagram page. Those photos included one of a designer bag, another of a sushi meal on a private jet, and a third of a man and woman's legs crossed, which was previously shared by a different user on Twitter in July.</p><p>These photos have not appeared on Landon's actual Instagram page, but have reportedly been featured in his Stories, and suggest that he may be sharing other people's photos in order to exaggerate the extent of his own wealth.</p><p>After seeing the evidence that the photos had been lifted from other accounts, users said that they would be mortified to have been caught misleading their followers in this way. Landon's life seems to be far from perfect at the moment, and even those who follow him online are beginning to question the content they're being served.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflsK0wMinZJqmlGK5orrDqKVmpZOXv7C7zGanmqqVo8G0</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
