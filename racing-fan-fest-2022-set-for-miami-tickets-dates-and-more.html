In addition to buying clothing, lifestyle gear and more, fans can also take the Red Bull pit stop challenge to test their speed to see if they have what it takes to make it as an F1 crew member. Visitors can also learn about the teams or watch the race on a massive LED installation at this all-ages destination.</p><p>The AT&T VR Racing Simulators will help audience members feel like they’re putting the pedal to the metal. There will be a total of six virtual reality simulators in two areas, with one at The Racing Simulator Stage and another inside the AT&T Zone. Those who try the experience will get to sit in the driver’s seat with a VR headset as they compete with friends and family in a Formula 1 race.</p><p>The official Formula 1 Merch store will be a top attraction for <a href=#>diehard racing fans</a>. The shopping destination will sell authentic and licensed F1 and Grand Prix merchandise, including teamwear, fan apparel and accessories. Expect some 2021 Formula 1 World Champion<strong> Max Verstappen</strong> merchandise and memorabilia too.</p><p>Racing Fan Fest 2022 isn’t just about <a href=#>the cars and drivers</a>.
