The upcoming season of Fox’s famous singing competition will include a fresh structure, themed episodes, costumes, and celebrity visitors. The panel of judges, however, as well as the presenter, will remain the same.&nbsp;The Masked Singer is a celebrity singing reality program that involves renowned singers concealed under elaborate costumes while performing each week. The competitor who successfully conceals its identity while producing outstanding performances throughout the event will win and get a large monetary award.</p><p>According to the show’s official synopsis:</p><p>“THE MASKED SINGER, based on an international hit with over half a billion fans worldwide and the No. 1 top-trending video of 2017 on YouTube, features celebrities competing against one another with one major twist: each singer is shrouded from head to toe in an elaborate costume, complete with a full face mask to conceal his or her identity.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/The-Masked-Singer-2.jpg alt="The Masked Singer" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>More information is being uncovered ahead of the season 8 debut of The Masked Singer.</h2><p>In the forthcoming season of The Masked Singer, viewers can expect to see a lot of new stuff. Each show will include numerous performances, but only one contender will advance. The studio audience will vote for their favorite singer, and the vocalist with the fewest votes will be forced to reveal their identity in the middle of the program. The ousted singer, on the other hand, would be able to watch the show from the luxury of the VIP studio.&nbsp;Following the unveiling of the first celebrity, the remaining two performers will compete to the same song. The winner will then proceed to join the other candidates. The Semi-Finals will include the three finalists from each of the three rounds.</p><p>Season 8 will be unique in that each episode will be focused on a different subject. Each episode has a different title, such as Vegas Night, Comedy Roast, Hall Of Fame, Muppets Night, Andrew Lloyd Webber Night, TV Themes, 90s Night, Thanksgiving, and Fright Night.&nbsp;Donny Osmond, Andrew Lloyd Webber, The Muppets, Will Arnett, Leslie Jordan, Joel McHale, Tori Spelling, Jon Lovitz, Jodie Sweetin, Carrot Top, Blue Man Group, Lance Bass, Danielle Fishel, Drew Carey, and Sheila E. will all feature on the program in the forthcoming season.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/The-Masked-Singer-1.jpg alt="The Masked Singer" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Who will serve as a judge in Season 8 of The Masked Singer?</h2><p>Aside from Nick Cannon returning as host, the event will include all four of its usual judges: Robin Thicke, Jenny McCarthy, Ken Jeong, and Nicole Scherzinger.&nbsp;The show’s hidden celebrity competitors have a combined 32 Grammy Nominations, 16 Emmy Wins, 8 Gold Albums, 4 Golden Globe Nominations, 42 Books, 10 Teen Choice Awards, and 5 Hollywood Walk of Fame Stars.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiroZ1doq60t8SdZKyhnpyys3nSnpisp55ihW610maqnqxdqbxursRmqZ6klZbAprCMqKVmrJiaeqe712aaoZmeo7KtedKopqdn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
