I never meant to hurt you, I never meant to lead you on.</p><p>"I truthfully and honestly enjoyed spending time with you.”</p><img

on the series together, Brendan and Pieper were caught discussing their Instagram followers.</p><p>They certainly seemed to be on Bachelor in Paradise for those dreaded wrong reasons, <a href=#>something Morais practically admitted</a> to after he departed the program.</p><p>In his mea culpa, Brendan denied that he and Pieper had any sort of plan.</p><p>He claimed the two weren’t trying to manipulate anyone or anything or accomplish any sort of underhanded goal.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“Pieper and I were not in an exclusive relationship,” Brendan said in his video.</p><p>“I absolutely went to Paradise [as] a single man…</p><p>"As far as Pieper and I having this big, elaborate plan, I’m not the smartest person in the world, for sure, but I feel like it would have gone just a little bit better than it did if we had this plan.</p><p>"Of course, it went horrible in every way.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Morais went on to address his fellow contestants’ allegation that he agreed to do the show merely to increase his fame, saying it was “not the case” that he was there for anything except love.</p><p>“If I wanted the max amount of followers, I would not have pursued Pieper or Natasha,” Morais continued.</p><p>“I would have went after a girl with a million followers…</p><p>"Everyone saying I’m there for TV and all that stuff is just ironic and silly, as they’re mic’ed up and in an interview with a camera in their face saying that I’m there for TV, but fully understanding that they’re speaking to a camera that’s going to air their words on TV.”</p><img

by stating he’s still working on improving his communication skills, which he blames for many of the problems during his run on the show.</p><p>“I just want everyone to know that I acknowledge where I went wrong and I need to continue to work on myself as a man and learn and try to be a better person.</p><p>"I know that I’m a good person, I know I’m a good man, but I need to continue to grow and that’s that.”</p><p>All this said, it sounds very much as if Pieper and Brendan are, indeed, a couple.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Earlier this month, James told Us Weekly that she and Brendan are still “working through things” after leaving Paradise.</p><p>“This obviously isn’t something that’s super healthy for a relationship either, so it kind of is what it is,” she explained.</p><p>“Every day, [we’re] taking it day by day."</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li
