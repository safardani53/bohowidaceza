The NFL coach is under fire after a video of him dancing with a young woman at a bar went viral.</p><p>The 57-year-old former Ohio State coach trended online for several days after his return to the Buckeye state resulted in footage of a woman who is not his wife of 37 years, <strong>Shelley Meyer</strong>, grinding on his lap over the weekend.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/NFL-Coach-Urban-Meyers-Wife-Shelley-Speaks-Out-After-Viral-Video-of-Him-Dancing-With-Another-Woman.jpg><p>“I just apologized to the team and the staff for being a distraction,” Urban said in a press conference on Monday, October 4. “It was stupid. So I explained everything that happened. And owned it. And, you know, just stupid. I should not have myself in that kind of position.”</p><p>He added that his family was “upset,” noting he stayed in Ohio after the Jags game to “see the grandkids, and we all went to dinner that night.”</p><p>“There was a big group next to our restaurant, and they wanted me to come over and take pictures and I did,” he continued. “[They were] trying to pull me out on the dance floor, screwing around, and I should have left.”</p><p>As the backlash continued, Shelley, who previously tweeted “#BuddyDeservedANightOut” as the videos and photos started to surface, announced she was leaving Twitter.</p><p>“Frankly, I don’t need the hate, vitriol, slander, trash that will @ me (this has never stopped anyway),” she wrote on Thursday, October 7, before standing by her husband. “We all make mistakes-we are all sinners. If you think you aren’t? Then cast the first stone.”</p><p>Shelley concluded her message: ”To my wonderful followers/friends: THANK YOU. For your love, support, friendship, laughs-I will miss this the most. I love you ALL and wish God’s blessings on you. Thank you #FaithFamilyFootballFlamingos.”</p><p>Jaguars owner <strong>Shad Khan</strong>, meanwhile, called Urban’s behavior “inexcusable” in a Facebook statement on Tuesday, October 5.</p><p>“I have addressed this matter with Urban. I appreciate Urban’s remorse, which I believe is sincere. Now, he must regain our trust and respect,” Khan wrote via Facebook. “That will require a personal commitment from Urban to everyone who supports, represents or plays for our team. I am confident he will deliver.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>According to <a href=#>USA Today</a>, the woman in question in the video with Urban is a 24-year-old whose marketing company has launched an investigation into how her behavior has affected the workplace.</p><p>“(She) can’t even go anywhere. It’s ruining her life is what it’s doing,” her mother told the outlet. “I’m worried for her emotional status right now. … She needs this job. She just bought a house.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGauqpKWu265xLKcq6tdrLansYysn56knJrGbr7Empqtq12pvG60yKZknZmemLavs4ywoK2gXZa7sMDHnqlmr5%2Birq97</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
