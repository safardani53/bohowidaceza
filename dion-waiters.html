He was taken to his father, Dion Waiters Sr., and his mother, Monique Brown.</span></p><p><span>Monique Brown solely raised Dion for the longest time. Her former husband, Dion Sr., was in jail when their son was born.</span></p><p><span>His grandmother’s death followed Dion’s birth. She died four hours after her grandson’s birth.</span></p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Dion-Waiters-with-his-sister-2-820x1024.jpg></p><p><span>He did not have the most fortunate childhood. The only thing that has remained constant in the Waiter’s life for the longest time is basketball. He has loved playing basketball since childhood.</span></p><p><span>He played with it regardless of the weather and time. It turned out to be something of peaceful practice. Above all, it made his heart happy.</span></p><p><span>His parents parted ways with a divorce. His mother then remarried James Barnes.</span></p><p><span>Dion has a sister: Janiya. His younger brother, Demetrius Pinckney, lost his life in an unfortunate incident.</span></p><p><strong>You might be interested in reading:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">RJ Barrett: Family, Basketball Career, Net Worth, & Wiki >></a></strong></p><h3><span>The Family Tragedy</span></h3><p><span>Demetrius Pinckney died at the age of 20.

His little brother was the biggest mama’s boy in the neighborhood.</span></p><p><span>He watched his little brother grow from being a crybaby to a fan of his own.
