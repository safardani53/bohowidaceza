Her employers' noticed the loss in December, called police and she was arrested.</p><p>Lopez had told her he wanted to set up home and marry her, but&nbsp;needed money to be released from a security contract in Dubai.</p><p>Fooled Wareing burnt through all her own money, then turned&nbsp;to the accounts of her employers, solicitors' firm Easthams.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nintchdbpict000360018311.jpg><p>Following sentencing, Detective Constable Mark Riley of Lancashire Police said: "This has been a complex and at times challenging investigation which highlights the impact online fraud can have on not just one but two victims.</p><p>"Pamela Wareing, a woman who had worked for her employer for more than 20 years, was duped by an internet fraudster into sending vast sums of money to a man she would never meet.</p><p>"She was taken in by their lies, first transferring small sums of her own money and then spending her own savings.</p><p>"She took out loans and used money on her credit card incurring significant debt before accessing&nbsp;accounts to send larger sums abroad.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/nintchdbpict000309675527.jpg><p>"Wareing became convinced she would meet with 'Lopez' but it was clear this individual had no intention of doing so.</p><p>"I have no doubt Lopez is a fictitious person, a name made up by the whole team behind this elaborate scam.</p><p>"Wareing used her own money to fund the fraud, but once this had stopped she turned to her employers. She was selfish and did not think about the impact of her theft.</p><p>"Easthams trusted Wareing and she was held in high regard, but her thoughtless actions were to leave the company in a potentially perilous financial position close to Christmas.</p><p>"I have spoken with John Bower and Debra Hepplestall, who are the senior partners at Easthams. They are still concerned about the impact Wareing's actions may have. I can state that there is no blame associated with the firm.</p><p>"This investigation demonstrates the dangers of online dating and the potential there is to become a victim of fraud."</p><p>Pam Smith, prosecuting, said that Wareing had betrayed a "high position of trust at the office where she worked."</p><p>While her lawyer Brett Chappell told the court: “This is a tragedy for all concerned - my client and her employer.</p><p>“She accepted her culpability during long interviews at the police station. She was preyed on by a scam artist and was as much a victim as Easthams.”</p><p>John Bower, a solicitor and director at Easthams, said: “Investigations are still ongoing. “We are very much the victims of this crime.</p><p>"There has been no loss to any client. We are content to let the matter proceed through the judicial process."</p><p><strong>We pay for your stories! Do you have a story for The Sun Online news team?
