Now she’s showing fans what the workout look was for, as the 40-year-old has become a brand ambassador for Olly gummy vitamins. Rebel appeared in the first commercial spots that debuted on Feb. 10, while announcing her new gig on her Instagram page.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>“Excited to announce that I’m not just an <a class=notranslate tabindex=0 href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>@ollywellness</a> fan… I’m now an OLLY ambassador!!

Photo credit: YouTube.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>In the new commercial that dropped — which you can watch above — an alarm goes off as Rebel gets out of bed with tons of energy. She grabs a bottle of the product and says “Hey, wake up. Take your Olly gummies and dominate your day!” Rebs then walks into a bright pink room filled with workout equipment and is seen in the pink leggings and orange crop top. “Because when you take Olly gummies, nothing can stop you,” she says with a smile after tossing over a workout tire and lifting a kettlebell.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>“I don’t even stop for mirrors ’cause I now I’m already gorgeous!” Rebel declares, as she looks stunning in a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pink evening gown</a> in another scene from the ad where she’s poses at a photo shoot.

The two split up after a over year of dating, though she didn’t take their relationship public until a Sept. 24, 2020 gala in Monaco where she <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>made Jacob red carpet official</a>. They were last seen <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>making out</a> during a pre-Christmas trip to Aspen, in a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>romantic photo</a> Rebel shared to her Instagram. But she let the world know <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>they were over</a> in Feb. 2 IG post where she was seen in a denim dress standing outside of a production trailer.
