Dykes was sentenced to life in prison for the murder and an additional 20 years for the tampering offense.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Botello-Valadez had come to Dallas from Seattle, Wash., on Oct. 2, 2020 to visit a friend, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>PEOPLE previously reported</a>, citing investigators. Two days later, she took a Lyft from her friend's home and never returned. She had reportedly gone out alone to visit several nightclubs in the city's Deep Ellum entertainment district, where she had met a man named Charles Beltran.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Prosecutors said Dykes went into a “jealous rage” and fatally stabbed Botello-Valadez after seeing her in bed with her boyfriend, Beltran, Fox 4 reports. According to prosecutors, Dykes had been in a three-way relationship with Beltran and her wife, Nina Marano.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, during the trial, Dykes testified that Beltran was only a business associate of hers and their interests had shifted, WFAA reports. Prosecutors said Dykes then disposed of Botello-Valadez’s body.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Botello-Valadez’s body was found in a wooded area in Wilmer, Texas, five months later, on March 24, 2021, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>PEOPLE previously reported.</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"For some reason, she lost it that night,” Dykes’ defense attorney, Heath Harris, said in court, according to Fox 4. “That’s sudden passion. That’s what you heard from the witness stand.” Harris has reportedly filed a notice of appeal.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Marisela Botello-Valadez.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Facebook</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The investigation led authorities to Dykes, Marano and Beltran. Dykes and Marano were <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>arrested in Florida</a> in March while Beltran was taken into custody in Utah in April. All three were charged with murder.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dykes and Marano were arrested a second time in February 2022 after posting bond, and then allegedly removing their GPS monitors strapped to their ankles and fleeing to Cambodia, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>PEOPLE previously reported.</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Using cell phone records, police were able to determine that Marano, Dykes and Beltran were with Botello-Valadez at the home of Dykes and Beltran in Mesquite, Texas, "on the last date [Botello-Valadez] was known to be alive," according to Marano’s arrest affidavit, which was previously reviewed by PEOPLE.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A search of Dykes' and Beltran's home "revealed that the carpet had been cleaned, but streaks of brown and red color, the appearance of blood, were underneath the carpet," the affidavit stated.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Last week, the Dallas County District Attorney’s Office filed motions to dismiss the murder charges against Beltran and Marano, both of whom testified during Dykes’ trial, NBC 5 reports.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At the sentencing hearing, Botello-Valadez’s brother said in a victim impact statement that his family is finding a way to move forward in their lives “despite this tragedy [that happened] to us,” according to Fox 4.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I hope that you get what you deserve in that prison cell," Luis Botello-Valadez added, referring to Dykes.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6SaxaK%2FjLCmppmeYrOwwc2dZKCtmaHBunnKoqOloZ6cerW71KugrKxdn7KiuM6uqmaqkZyyboSTam1pamY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
