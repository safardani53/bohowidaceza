The 30-year-old is not planning to return to film <i>Bachelor in Paradise</i> season 4, multiple sources confirm to <i>Us Weekly</i>.</p><p>The <i>Bachelorette</i> alum, who competed on <b><a href=#>Rachel Lindsay</a></b>’s season 13, <a href=#>was invited back to the ABC summer dating show</a> after <a href=#>Warner Bros. found no evidence of alleged misconduct</a> — but he plans to decline the offer, sources say.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/demario-jackson-inline-489d02c5-6758-4c97-ae0f-581b0fe166b1.jpg><p>“DeMario does not feel it is a good idea for him to go back on the show, he is taking time away to focus on himself,” one insider tells <i>Us</i>. “What he went through was very difficult, and he doesn’t feel it is in best interest to go back at this time.”</p><p>The controversy began when a producer claimed misconduct in the workplace after Jackson and fellow contestant <b><a href=#>Corinne Olympios</a></b> were allegedly getting hot and heavy in a pool while filming in Mexico. Production was shut down while Warner Bros. conducted an investigation.</p><p><a href=#>Jackson insisted he did nothing wrong</a> and told <i>Us</i> in a statement that his “character and family name has been assassinated.” Warner Bros. later confirmed that Jackson was in the clear.</p><span class=caption></span><p>“Out of respect for the privacy interests of those involved, we do not intend to release the videotape of the incident,” Warner Bros. told <i>Us</i> in a statement on June 20. “We can say, however, that the tape does not support any charge of misconduct by a cast member. Nor does the tape show, contrary to many press reports, that the safety of any cast member was ever in jeopardy.”</p><p>The cast is returning to Mexico to resume shooting for the show, which will still air this summer, ABC confirmed to <i>Us</i>. An insider told <i>Us</i> that many season 4 cast members, including <b>Robby Hayes</b>, <b>Raven Gates</b>, <b>Vinny Ventiera </b>and <b>Amanda Stanton</b> have been asked back.</p><p>Stanton, 27, told <i>Us Weekly</i> on Thursday, June 22, that she’s excited to start filming again. “I’m glad that it picked back up and that everything is moving along,” she said. As for whether Olympios and Jackson will be heading back to Paradise, she said, “I don’t think so.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Despite the show resuming, <a href=#>Olympios’ lawyer <b>Marty Singer</b> is still gathering details</a> about the incident. “It comes as no surprise that Warner Bros., as a result of its own internal Investigation, would state that no wrong doing had occurred,” he told <i>Us</i> in a statement on June 20. “Our own investigation will continue based on multiple new witnesses coming forward revealing what they saw and heard.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGadnZ2Wv6q7jKOYnKOjpLtutdJmpaisXaW5orrNoqWgZaSkerOx066pp2WkpHqjrcKhnKWnomK2r3nPmqmanJmosm7Dk3FwbGthZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
