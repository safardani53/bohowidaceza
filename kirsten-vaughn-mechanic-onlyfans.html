Once they looked into the matter, Kirsten says that management didn't reprimand the other employees, but instead "blamed" Kirsten for creating an OnlyFans.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"I had a coworker come up to me and ... he was telling me how the salesmen were all huddled up in a group, and that he had come up to the group and they were on an OnlyFans page. And he said that he didnâ€™t know it was me until they passed by a picture of my face and he said, â€˜Iâ€™ve seen a lot of you,'" Kristen told BuzzFeed.</p><p>She said two employees were especially fixated on her OnlyFans account.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"They literally would not shut up about my page. I begged them to not tell anybody, and they would laugh in my face and say, â€˜Ha ha ha, weâ€™re helping you make money, shut up."</p><p>Kirsten revealed to her managers that she did wear her work uniform in some of the photos on her OnlyFans, and she also uploaded pictures from the dealership's bathroom, but made sure no visible logos or discernible imagery were in the pictures.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Really a shame they had to fire me for having my only fans page, cuz I got down at my dealership.<br>Here's me doing a complete a/c system replacement due to "black death" <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/zLBlbI5KHZ</a></p>â€” Ms Red ðŸŽ‚ (@vermilionvixxxn) <a href=#>April 20, 2020</a> <span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"If the guys just wouldâ€™ve watched their porn at home, none of this wouldâ€™ve happened. But instead of looking at it like, â€˜Hey, the guys are kind of creepy,â€™ itâ€™s, â€˜Oh well, youâ€™re the girl that brought this to their attention, and youâ€™re responsible," she continued.</p><p>Although she was fired from the Don Ayres dealership right around Valentine's Day 2020, it's when she recently tweeted about the circumstances surrounding her firing that the story blew up.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"Really a shame they had to fire me for having my only fans page, cuz I got down at my dealership," Kirsten wrote.</p><p>Head of human resources for the Honda location, Jason Johnston insists that Kirsten's OnlyFans account wasn't the reason for her termination, but that she had "violated company policy." However, the didn't specify which policy she was specifically found breaching.</p><p>It also doesn't help the business' claims that Kirsten recorded her meeting with her superiors Jason and John Watkins.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In the clips, John can be heard saying, "If I walked out into the shop and spread a rumor, how other people react to it, thatâ€™s their responsibility, but Iâ€™m still the one who yelled fire," along with other sound bytes where the two men appear to blame the unwanted attention Kirsten received from her coworkers on the young mechanic, and not her harassers.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"If there were coworkers over there who had access to your page, that might encourage them to approach you with unwanted sexual conduct or comments," Jason can be heard saying in a recording.</p><p>There's been a huge uptick in OnlyFans account creations in the wake of the coronavirus, where more and more people are considering sex work as a means of supplementing their income until they can get back to their regular employment.</p><p>Those with experience as sex workers, like adult film actress Asia Akira, has cautioned those streaming content to services like Snapchat Premium and OnlyFans: "People will find out. Your best friends and your worst enemies will all eventually find out," the actress said.</p><p>Kirsten's job performance at the Honda dealership was previously praised by higher-ups, who even posting a video to their Facebook page applauding her for her work.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>"I was a phenomenal employee with a perfect record that never got in trouble. When I went to work and I was on the clock, I did my job and I was good at it. I was appropriate when I was at work. I wore my uniform. I did what I had to do," Kirsten said. Jason confirmed that Kirsten was a stellar worker: "We think very highly of her," he told BuzzFeed.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Kirsten says that she started her OnlyFans in order to help pay off her student loans, put money toward her mortgage, and help realize her dream of one day owning a race car garage/shop.</p><p>She also added that she wasn't the only employee with a page on the paid service; another female colleague, Caryn Looper, also received harassment from male coworkers once they discovered her OnlyFans. One employee had groped Caryn's butt after asking what "$20" would get him.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>She ultimately quit her job and a police report was filed against the employee for sexual battery in the same day. In her recording with Jason and John, Kirsten referenced the treatment that Caryn had endured at the dealership, to which John responded, "Absolutely! Sexual harassment that you would find personally unwelcome, and that's something I would be concerned about for you."</p><p>Ever since joining OnlyFans, Kirsten says she's earned way more money from her page than she ever did at working in the shop. And ever since being subjected to harassment from her coworkers, she's working to advocate for sex workers' rights: "It highlights how sex workers are not properly protected. and it can also be used as a lesson learned for people who want to keep their day job."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoLazv9OepWaukaq0qbqMppycoJGjtqR5zqejsp6Ro8A%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
