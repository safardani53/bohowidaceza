She recently spoke about her experience doing the new show and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said that</a>, "The biggest thing for me for this challenge was being by myself, because I had a partner in every single one of my other challenges."</p><p>“I think I was worried I was going to overthink everything.

"Life was more simple [while doing the show]. It’s weird, it’s like you tap into a different part of your brain. You’re waking up a part of yourself that’s been asleep for so long. Because there’s no technology, there’s no lights, there’s no bad news… It’s hard to put into words, but it’s really powerful — and you miss it."</p><p>With no newcomers and a few trailblazers from the original series, Naked and Afraid: Solo is sure to be a real nail-biting competition.
