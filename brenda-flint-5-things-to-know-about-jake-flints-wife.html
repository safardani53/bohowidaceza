My heart is gone and I just really need him to come back. I can’t take much more. I need him here.”</p><p>One day earlier — two days after <a href=#>they exchanged vows</a> — Brenda expressed her disbelief that her new husband was gone. “I don’t understand,” she wrote next to heart-wrenching footage from their nuptials, in which<a href=#> they were filmed dancing and kissing</a> for the camera with huge grins on their faces. She also changed her profile picture to a soft-focused image that appears to be from their wedding. The “What’s Your Name?” singer had his hand on the side of his bride’s face while the two kissed.</p><p>Per the couple’s social media accounts, the Flints were based in Tulsa, Oklahoma, as Jake performed all around his home state and neighboring Texas. The “Hurry Up & Wait” artist <a href=#>proposed to Brenda</a> in January. They tied the knot 11 months later.</p><p>Musician <strong>Mike Hosty</strong>, who performed at <a href=#>the couple’s wedding</a> on Saturday, recalled the “rainy” but “fun” bash to<a href=#> The Oklahoman</a> and noted he still has “the mud in my old van,” adding, “And it’s just a tragedy what happened.”</p><p>Jake’s manager, <strong>Brenda Cline</strong>, asked her Facebook friends to “please please pray for his new wife Brenda, Jake’s precious mother, his sister and the rest of his family and friends.”</p><p>“This is going to be incredibly difficult for so many,” she <a href=#>continued</a>, calling Jake’s sudden death is “so surreal.” She concluded her tribute by writing, “We love you Jake and in our hearts forever. 💔.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The newlyweds showed off the playful side of their romance on social media. In addition to the wedding video Brenda shared — in which the two bust out some silly dance moves — <a href=#>Jake played an April Fool’s Day prank</a> earlier this year by pretending that he and Brenda were expecting. While posting a doctored sonogram photo of a baby giving the “OK” sign, the singer — who also apologized if he offended anyone with the joke — wrote alongside the image, “No little one on the way for us. We gotta get bona fide, in good faith, hitched up before we consider that!”</p><p>Keep scrolling to learn more about Jake’s widow.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkr7OxzZ2YZp6cnru1eZRmq6GhnpzAbsDOZqKnp6dirqO71K1ko5mbmnqnuMinq6xlp56zpns%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
