It's not flattering, it's creepy."</p><p>She added in a video: "I honestly despair sometimes. Don't get me wrong I love boobs like everyone else.</p><p>"But I can't imagine looking through a story, especially one about mental health, and thinking 'Oh, I like their boobs I'm gonna let them know'."</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Further on in the Q&A another user wrote: "Every time I see your pictures I get arouse, can we have a good time together?"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NINTCHDBPICT000584345764.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ashley.png><p class=mol-para-with-font>Ashley responded: "Wow, because you've put it so nicely yeah I'd love to leave my lovely, respectful and kind boyfriend for someone who is aroused by my photos."</p><p>The radio presenter - who previously opened up about her body insecurities - then called out a follower who sent her a private message asking about her cup size.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The user wrote: "Beautiful boobs, I like it. What is the new size? Sorry I don't want to be creepy..."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ashley-3.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ashley-4.png><p class=mol-para-with-font>Ashley posted a screenshot of the message and raged: 'Just for avoidance of doubt... If you're a man asking my boob size or commenting on my boobs, you're creepy.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>"I post this content for women, especially my fellow big-boobed women. Unless you're getting in touch to ask about it as a gift for your wife/girlfriend, I really don't need to know your thoughts on my boobs and you really don't need to know what size they are."</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Another follower then replied to that, saying: "It is a normal situation, if you show your boobs, you should be ready for creepy man."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NINTCHDBPICT000549485488.jpg><p class=mol-para-with-font>Ashley shot back: "This attitude stinks. Men walk around with their tops off and we can control ourselves.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>"We don't tell men they're asking for it. Nature gave me big boobs, I'm not going to cover my body or be ashamed of it, or stop helping other women with big boobs from finding good lingerie just because a small portion of men have been brought up with no respect for women.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>"The audacity and privilege. I can't."</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She went on: "So if a bloke walked up to you in a bar and said 'great t**s' you should go 'well I'm wearing a tank top I did ask for that', how's a message any different?</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>"I think blokes on here need to ask themselves, before pressing send, 'now if I said that to this person face to face would I seem like someone who needs to go on a register?'."</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The reality star concluded: "It's not a normal situation at all and people trying to normalise this behaviour are worse than the perpetrators."<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hwZmyFd3yOppidnV2eu26vx56jrJ2RYq60tMuesGaikaKytHnTq6alpF2Xv6at0q2qaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
