Thankfully, the things players must undertake don't seem too difficult, and the end reward is pretty amazing.</p><p>The official Epic Games blog post on the update reads, "Neymar Jr. can be contained no more! Starting this week on April 27, you can tackle his Battle Pass Quests, allowing you to unlock his Outfit and other items from his high-octane Set. By completing Neymar Jr. Quests and Epic-rarity Quests, unlock and unleash his primal forms."</p><p>Beyond the unlockable skin of Neymar himself, there are plenty of other cool features that revolve around the famed soccer player's addition to the game.

There's a substantial list of achievements that need to be completed before he becomes available, and players can undertake it in any order.&nbsp;</p><p>One task is that players must drop-kick the in-game soccer ball toy at least 500 meters as Neymar, which will reward them with the Joia Trophy Back Bling. Next, talking to a soccer player on the island to unlock the soccer ball emote, as well as a Neymar Jr. banner. Beyond that, eliminating three opponents as Neymar will unlock his "primal" self.</p><p>The tasks don't end there, though! Three other quests are available, which will unlock the new Matador loading screen. Speaking of quests, scoring a goal with the soccer ball toy as Neymar Jr. will reward a player with the Jaguar Strike Pickaxe. Last but not least, completing five quests from island soccer players will fully unlock the skin, allowing users free rein to maneuver the island forever as one of the world's most famous soccer stars.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnby4edOoZKCdpGK7psXMmqlmoqJitq95xaipraaZqbI%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
