I love him very much. This man has brought me a lot of joy and pain.</p><p>“My love life has been a lot more turbulent than I’ve ever let on, and I’m so sad about my relationship with Kenny. I’m sorry for any pain.”</p><p>Kenny says George’s spiraling drug use led to clashes, with George hitting back over his lover’s boozing.</p><p>Kenny&nbsp;said: “When I confronted him, he never denied it, never apologised. He was hard on me about drinking, because I developed a problem.”</p><p>However,&nbsp;Kenny continued to support his ex, accompanying George on a court appearance in 2010 and visiting him in an Austrian hospital when he contracted pneumonia in 2011.</p><p>The singer wrote “Where I Hope You Are” about his former lover, with lyrics that said:&nbsp;“For so long there’s been no-one else I care about. That my heart could really be so wrong again, well it wears me out. I had a picture in my soul, some place warm we could hang out when we’re old. Now it’s just – where I hope you are.”</p><p>In an interview with the <a href=# rel=noopener>Daily Mail</a> in 2022, Kenny revealed that they broke up in part due to substance abuse and alcoholism and that he was always worried about him.</p><p>He explained: "We all expected him to die. I had spent so much time when we lived together, being worried about him.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>"Honestly, he hated the fact that I worried about him so much. What's the line he says in one of his songs? He says, "I can see it in your eyes when you look at me that way, it tears me in two". And it really did. I just didn't know what to do.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>"I was worried about him all the time. Please don't say that the wrong way, if you love someone you are worried about them."</p><h2>What happened in the weeks leading up to George Michael’s death?</h2><p><a href=#>George</a> went through some of the darkest times of his life in the years following their split, culminating in a lengthy stint in the world’s most expensive rehab clinic in Switzerland.</p><p>The former Wham! star had been dating Australian-born celebrity hair stylist <a href=#>Fadi Fawaz</a>, who he met soon after the breakdown of him and Kenny’s relationship.</p><p>However, friends of Kenny and George told The Sun how the pair had rekindled their friendship, sparking hopes of a romantic reunion.</p><p>A close friend revealed: “George and Kenny are back spending time together again and it’s an exciting time for those of us who have been so worried over the last few years.”</p><p>Pals believe George’s long-awaited music comeback would have been more likely if his relationship with Kenny had come to fruition.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Fight for humanity</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>Kenny spoke out to raise the profile of the pair’s charitable Goss-Michael Foundation.
