"It's a tad hokey but you get to hear Katharine sing a lot."</p><p>Another said: "The singing was the best part otherwise it was just awkward and full of bad accents. Does it get better after episode 1?"</p><p>It's not the first show to hit Netflix recently leaving viewers in tears - as fans of WandaVision were left sobbing by the finale's emotional 'roller coaster' post-credits scene.</p><p>Much like Country Comfort, the popular superhero series has now come to an end and fans demand a season 2 so the story can continue.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Streaming</h2></p><p>Fans' emotion were all over the place wept as one wept: "This is THE episode that made me full on SOB and weep."</p><p>Actress Katharine, 36, recently welcomed her first son with David Foster hours after she announced they expected a baby BOY.</p><p>The singer-actress and her husband, music producer David Foster, 71, revealed they were expecting their first child together in October.</p><p>On Wednesday, a source close to the A-listers confirmed that the American Idol alum welcomed her firstborn.&nbsp;</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Katharine McPhee says she is ‘relieved’ to have a baby boy as she doesn’t have to worry about ‘certain things’</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2ispmR%2FdoORbGpxZ5uWwamt0aKlnmWdmL2pscRmpZ6slqG2uXnCqKynrKKueqS7zJ%2Bmq6xdm66vv4ytnJqqo2Q%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
