The pair stepped out in West Hollywood together on March 9 for a sweet date night! They were all smiles as they left Craig’s restaurant. They both kept it casual for the outing. Russell donned dark slacks and a black and white t-shirt that advertised The Young And Brave Foundation for children with cancer. Love it! Meanwhile Ciara looked chic in jeans and a white shirt under a leather bomber jacket. Both of them also had a bit of a twinning moment by sporting matching dog tag necklaces. See the pics of them below!</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>While they left the kids at home for the outing, fans were finally able to get a glance at their daughter recently! Their precious baby girl was born on April 28, 2017, but it took nearly a year for the “1, 2 Step” singer to share the first photo of her on Feb. 15. The images were shared on her app, and showed her holding the adorable infant. She and the Seattle Seahawks quarterback certainly make great parents!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ciara-russell-wilson-date-night-post.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWloZH10e5BpZpyhkaeubr7UrKqepJxixKq40qilZqudnrmmv4ydmK2dXaO2qLTTZqernZejrq%2Bv2GaprqWfp8Bw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
