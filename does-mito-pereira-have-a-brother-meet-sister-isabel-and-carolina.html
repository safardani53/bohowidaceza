The two sisters continue to reside in Chile and are seen occasionally with their brother.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Though they might not always have time to attend their brother’s golf tournament, Isabel, Carolina, and their parents are a supportive bunch.</p><p>The three siblings graduated from San Isidro and have taken different routes in their professional life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/mito-pereira.jpg><p>In the ongoing PGA Championship, Mito is competing alongside his fellow Chilean golfer, <a href=# rel=noopener>Joaquin Niemann</a>. The two golfers play for LIV Golf and are in the team Torque GC.&nbsp;</p><p>Last year he threw the chances of becoming the first Chilean to win a major championship at PGA. But this year, he hopes to write his name in golden letters in the history of golf.&nbsp;</p><h2>Does Mito Pereira Have A Brother? Meet Sister Isabel And Carolina</h2><p>Mito Pereira is the only brother of Isabel and Carolina Pereira. The three siblings were raised by their parents, Sibylle Hinke and Guillermo Pereira, in Santiago, Chile.</p><p>The two sisters of Mito Pereira have stayed away from the public limelight, but the golfer occasionally shares photos of his siblings. One such <a href=# rel=noopener>picture</a> was shared by Mito in 2021 with his sister Isabel and his wife, Antonia.&nbsp;</p><p>Like her brother, Isabel is a graduate of San Isidro high school. She previously worked in human resources at a truck transportation company, Transportes Labbe, in their homeland Chile.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/mito-pereira-sisters-isbael-and-carolina.jpg><p>Isabel worked at Transortes Labbe for only four months and left her job in December 2020. Since then, Isabel hasn’t updated her LinkedIn profile. Currently, Isabel resides in Pirque, Chile, and though available on Facebook, she is rarely seen updating it.&nbsp;</p><p>Mito’s other sister, Carolina Pereira, is also a graduate of San Isidro. And just like her sister, Isabel is rarely seen on her social media pages. With her <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram handle</a> private, Carolina hasn’t outed many details related to her personal life.</p><h2>Mito Pereira Married Life With Wife Antonia Prida</h2><p>The Chilean golfer and his wife Antonia Prida met with sheer luck on their side. Mito, who had already settled in Florida for his golf training, returned to Chile one year, and that is when he linked up with Antonia.</p><p>Antonia is an abstract artist and has shared most of her work on her business Instagram handle. The couple currently reside in Jupiter, Florida.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the first pictures of Antonia and her golfer husband dates back to 2013 on her Instagram handle. The two teenagers maintained their long-distance relationship for several years before becoming official.</p><p>In January 2021, Antonia took to her Instagram handle to share the exciting news of her engagement with Mito.</p><p>Antonia shared a photo of her showing off her sparkling diamond ring with Mito taking a selfie.&nbsp;</p><p>The young couple tied the knot on January 15, 2022, a year after the golfer’s proposal. The marriage ceremony took place in Lo Arcaya Park, surrounded by family and friends.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/mito-pereira-with-wife.jpg><p>Last year the couple celebrated Halloween by dressing up like a vampire and a vampiress. They shared a couple of pictures on their Instagram celebrating the spooky day at Universal Orlando.&nbsp;</p><p>On their first anniversary this year, Mito shared the wedding video of them walking down the aisle and them dancing and enjoying the after-party.&nbsp;</p><p>Earlier this year, in April, Antonia caddied for her husband at Masters Par 3 Contest. She was also seen at the LIV Golf Adelaide event and walked the red carpet with her husband.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunCwzp6qZqWZqbxuvMSrnKKqkWK1osLEZphmmqKkwamx0Waknp2kYsCqv9OeqWaho5avpriMmqWdZZOWv7C4yKeYaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
