The 52-year-old filmed herself sucking on a jade colored lollipop while going for a car ride in an Instagram post shared on Saturday, April 23. Her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>rare green diamond engagement ring</a> from <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Ben Affleck</strong></a>, 49, was on full display as she smiled and laughed, clearly intending to show off the sparkler, worth over $5 million. “Green lollipop kisses,” the Bronx native wrote in her caption along with a green heart.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5><strong>Coi Leray</strong> and <strong>Nicki Minaj</strong>‘s bumpin’ “Blick Blick” was on full blast throughout the clip, clearly captioning J.Lo’s mood. “Push it, push it, click, , click/Yeah, pop up on the opp and watch it blick, blick (watch it),” Coi Leray raps over the beat. As always, the JLo Beauty founder’s glam was on point with that perfect glow and her signature nude glossy lip.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/JLo-Green-Lollipop-SS-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>Green is, of course, known to be Jen’s favorite color! “I always say the color green is my lucky color. Maybe you can remember a certain green dress,” she wrote on her OnTheJLo newsletter, referencing her iconic 2000s Versace look. “I’ve realized there are many moments in my life where amazing things happened when I was wearing green. It may be a coincidence, maybe not. But as I took a better look, I realized there are no coincidences.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>The lollipop video appeared to be filmed on April 5, as Jennifer was curiously wearing the same Zimmerman Juliette Tiered Silk Crepe Dress and Bottega Venata yellow bag from an outing with daughter <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Emme Muniz</strong></a>, 14, on the same day. Notably, the outing <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>sparked engagement speculation</a> as eagle-eyed fans noticed a new piece of jewelry on&nbsp;that&nbsp;finger — which she later confirmed just days later!</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Jennifer also filmed her engagement announcement video in the same ensemble, which she teased in a short video on April 8. “I have a really exciting and special story to share,” she said, pushing fans to her OnTheJLo newsletter where she dropped a short video showing off the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>unique and rare ring</a>! “Saturday night while at my favorite place on earth (in the bubble bath), my beautiful love got on one knee and proposed,” she wrote in her newsletter.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>“[I] just looked in his eyes smiling and crying at the same time trying hard to get my head around the fact that after 20 years this was happening all over again,” she explained. “I was quite literally speechless and he said, ‘Is that a yes?’ I said ‘YES of course that’s a YES.’” Of course, the couple were also engaged from 2002 to 2004 (but with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>a pink<strong> Harry Winston</strong> diamond</a>).</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>“I was smiling so big and tears were coming down my face, feeling so incredibly happy and whole. It was nothing fancy at all, but it was the most romantic thing I could’ve ever imagined,” she continued. “Just a quiet Saturday night at home, two people promising to always be there for each other. Two very lucky people. Who got a second chance at true love.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH11e5FsZqOdnqO2p7HRZqOoqJWveqi%2BxJ6lZqSfobmqvM6pZJ6ml5a0prnEp6tmqpmjtG7CyJ2cqGc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
