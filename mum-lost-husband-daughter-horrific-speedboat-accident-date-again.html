He said: ‘Promise me you won’t be on your own.’ So, I can almost feel him saying: “Get out there. Go and meet somebody.”</p><p>“I feel like he’s supporting me and I’ve never felt I’ve been unfaithful to him. I do find myself talking to him because I know him so well I know what he would say.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nintchdbpict000139709610.jpg><p>She added: “That boat could have hit anybody that day. It was completely random. It took Nico’s life and Emily’s life so they don’t have any more time. We do.</p><p>“I definitely feel we owe it to them to live life to the full and almost live their lives for them. They’re not here, so how dare we sit around not making the most of the time we’ve got.”</p><p>The Wandsworth mum, who says she is always attracted to men that resemble her late husband – tall, with silver-grey hair – started dating again after a friend who had met her husband on Tinder suggested she try it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nintchdbpict000139710646.jpg><h2>Is Victoria Milligan dating now?</h2><p>After a couple of disastrous dates with men who had “exaggerated their achievements” including an “outdoor design expert” who turned out to be a patio heater salesman – she deleted the app.</p><p>But she did have two brief romances with men she met on other dating websites.</p><p>She said: “Dating nowadays is nerve-racking. In the past you met someone through your friends or through work. Now so much of dating is on the internet, so you’re meeting complete strangers. ‘And what do you say on your profile? “Hello, single, widow, trauma victim, amputee.” That’s not exactly going to get the masses swiping right, is it?</p><p>“I still get a shock when I see it. I still can’t quite believe it’s me. Sometimes when I’m getting out of the bath and putting my prosthetic leg back on I think: “Oh God, that’s so unattractive.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nintchdbpict0003591548951.jpg><p>A year after the accident, Victoria had a brief fling with her children’s music teacher but admits she wasn’t ready for a new relationship because she hadn’t grieved properly for Nico.</p><p>She recently joined an upmarket dating agency, where she met a man she really liked and though she’d hit the jackpot.”</p><p>But after the fourth date, she decided to tell him the full story of the accident, her tragic loss and the truth about her leg.</p><p>She said: “If there’s ever going to be a passion killer that’s it."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nintchdbpict000066621675.jpg><p>The next day, he confessed that he didn’t think the relationship would work although they have since become friends.</p><p>But Victoria says she is still excited by the prospect of meeting someone else.</p><p>She said: “What’s so exciting at the moment is when you meet someone and you have that butterfly feeling. You’re super excited about getting ready and planning what you’re going to wear. It is a gorgeous feeling, that real adrenalin/serotonin rush.</p><p>“I feel ready now for whatever a new relationship is, whether it’s 24/7 or meeting a guy for dinner.”</p><p>While she says she is always going to miss her “perfect life,” Victoria says she has had to be strong for her children.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nintchdbpict000132862216.jpg><p>She said: “I was married to the most incredibly gorgeous man with four amazing children.</p><p>“Nico had a very high-powered job while I ran the house and looked after the children.</p><p>“I’m always going to be upset that that’s been taken away from me, but I also have to lead by example with the children.
