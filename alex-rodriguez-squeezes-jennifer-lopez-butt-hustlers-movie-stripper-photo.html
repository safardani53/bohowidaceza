During a break between scenes, the former <strong>New York Yankees</strong> player was photographed squeezing JLo’s perky butt, which a pair of tight white jeans accentuated even more. You can see the moment A-Rod got “caught” below.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>A-Rod was pumped for JLo’s new role even before the butt-grabbing picture surfaced. “This beautiful woman starts shooting her movie tomorrow, ‘Hustlers.’ I won’t play spoiler, but I can’t wait until you all see how she transforms herself into a completely different character!! She’s been working so hard lately,” the retired MLB star shared to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> on March 24, continuing, “I’m glad we were able to enjoy a quick little break before she dives into this new project. Love you baby and continue to shine, fly high and inspire all of us.” A-rod has extra reason to be proud of his bride-to-be, as she’s also earning a producer credit for the upcoming flick.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>A-Rod is JLo’s biggest cheerleader, even before he proposed to her with a massive diamond ring (estimated to be worth <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>$5 million</a>) in the Bahamas on March 9. He appeared by the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>actress and singer’s side</a> at the premiere for her latest movie, Second Act, in New York City in Dec. 2018. And when JLo took the stage at the MTV Video Music Awards to perform and shake her butt for the crowd in Aug. 2018, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>A-Rod’s face</a> said everything as he filmed the spicy moment.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/alex-rodriguez-squeezes-jennifer-lopezs-butt-on-the-set-of-her-new-stripper-movie-post.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>There’s even more reason to be excited for&nbsp;Hustlers&nbsp;beyond the anticipation of seeing JLo’s legendary dance moves. Grammy-winning rapper <strong>Cardi B</strong>, 26, is making her feature film debut in the new project, which is set to be released in 2020 and “follows a crew of savvy former strip club employees who band together to turn the tables on their Wall Street clients,” as inspired by the 2015&nbsp;New York Magazine&nbsp;article, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>IMDb</a>. The movie is packed with an A-list cast, as it also includes <strong>Constance Wu</strong> (Crazy Rich Asians), <strong>Lili Reinhart</strong> (Riverdale), <strong>Keke Palmer</strong> (Scream Queens) and <strong>Julia Stiles</strong> (10 Things I Hate About You).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlpZH10e5FwZpqkla16s7vDq6CgrZWverS91J6cs52jYremus2inZ6qXaG8sbHZZpmurKRitba%2F06Wcq6tdory3tcRmqq2qmaW9pr6MqZ%2BorJ9k</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
