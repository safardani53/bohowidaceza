She died at her home in Santa Barbara, California, according to the Santa Barbara News-Press.&nbsp;Herrin’s cause of death has not yet been established, while some media sites have stated that she died after being diagnosed with breast cancer. She rose to prominence after appearing in the 1984 picture Ghostbusters. The film’s fan site gave her respect, writing:</p><p>“We at Ghostbusters News extend our sympathies to Herrin’s family and friends, and we appreciate longtime reader Matthew Ballard for informing us of his death.”</p><p>Herrin’s funeral preparations have not yet been completed, but further details will be released shortly.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Playboy Playmate Kymberly Herrin dies at 65- as family asks for American Cancer Society donations <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/I2mCqR5RGb</a></p><p>— Daily Mail US (@DailyMail) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">November 16, 2022</a></p><h2>Kymberly Herrin played a ghost&nbsp;In Ghostbusters.</h2><p>Kymberly Herrin was well-known for her role as a ghost in Ghostbusters. She appears in Dan Aykroyd’s Ray Stantz’s s*x scene, perched on top of Ray’s bed before loosening his belt buckle.&nbsp;Her character has all of the characteristics of a ghost, including the ability to fly and morph into a pink cloud or mist. While her character was initially intended to be Ray’s love interest, her plot was removed to keep the picture moving.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Kymberly-Herrin-1.jpg alt="Kymberly Herrin" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Herrin’s sequences were shot at the Entertainment Effects Group, where optical effects were utilized to merge her into the Fort Deterring set. Kymberly’s tight-fitting gossamer gown required the team to put Vaseline all over her body in order to fit her into a mold particularly constructed for her role.&nbsp;The Dream Ghost, also known as the Fort Detmerring Ghost, was Herrin’s persona. She was the spirit of a lady who had died 150 years before. Her co-star in the film, Canadian actor Dan Aykroyd, revealed more about his role to Polygon last year. He stated:</p><p>“The ghost in the fort – the seduction ghost – that’s a regular occurrence in paranormal investigation, spirits doing s**ual things to humans.” My buddy had three ladies visit him at a haunted home in Louisiana, and it was one of the most memorable evenings of his life. But you certainly can’t have everything in under two hours.”</p><h2>All About Kymberly Herrin</h2><p>Kymberly Herrin was frequent on magazine covers and starred in the 1983 video for ZZ Top’s song Legs. During the 1980s, Herrin also starred in a few iconic films, including Romancing the Stone and Ghostbusters. Last year, Dan Aykroyd, a Canadian actor, told Polygon about the scene he filmed with Herrin and said:</p><p>“Yes. I recall the lady who played it. Kym Herrin, a Playboy Playmate, was her name. She was the ghost. I wish they’d let the sequence play out a bit longer.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Kymberly-Herrin-2.jpg alt="Kymberly Herrin" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Herrin’s family relatives survive her.
