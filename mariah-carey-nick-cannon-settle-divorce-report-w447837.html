They also kept the earnings they made during their six-year marriage due to a prenuptial agreement. (Carey and Cannon got married in April 2008 and <a href=#>split in December 2014</a>.)</p><p>“They are in a great place and a real source of support for one another — plus a prime example of what coparents should be,” the insider tells <i>Us</i>.</p><p>As previously reported, <a href=#>Carey’s rep confirmed</a> she and Packer, 49, had separated in a statement to <i>Entertainment Tonight</i> on Thursday, October 27: “Mariah and James had a fight in Greece, and have not seen each other since. The fight was not because of any cheating allegations or excessive spending by Mariah. James is one of the most successful businessmen in the world. They are trying to work it out. Right now, they’re not sure if they will stay together. They are discussing it, and plan to release an official statement together about their future.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>A source close to the Australian businessman exclusively told <i>Us Weekly</i> that the five-time Grammy winner’s life in the spotlight was <a href=#>too much for him to handle</a>. “Being in such a public relationship was fun for James at first, but then it got to be too much and he wanted his normal life back,” the insider explained.</p><p>A source close to Carey&nbsp;<a href=#>countered the reports</a> that Packer ended the relationship, telling <i>Us,</i> “James has not been present for [Mariah] so she unfortunately couldn’t make it work and had to leave him.”</p><p>Amid the drama, the “We Belong Together” entertainer may still keep the <a href=#>35-carat engagement ring</a> that Packer gave her when he proposed in January. “He’s not going to make her give the ring back because it’s against the law,” a second source close to Carey told <i>Us</i> of the ring, which is worth an estimated $10 million.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Carey was previously married to music exec <b><a href=#>Tommy Mottola</a></b> in the ’90s.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGammaKerql5wpqpnrFdo7akt4ycmKemn6N6tLHTraOeZZSew7C%2Bwp5kq52gpL%2B1edZta3BwY2x8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
