The new Bluebella for Victoria’s Secret collection features models of all different shapes, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>sizes, and genders</a>, including campaign muse and plus-size model, <strong>Ali Tate</strong>, along with transgender model, <strong>May Simón Lifschitz</strong>, as well as models <strong>Olivia Sang</strong> and <strong>Laura Rakhman-Kidd</strong>. Along with the new collection which features, bras, underwear, lingerie, sleepwear and more, the brands also released the #loveyourself campaign which sees all of the pieces on a diverse group of women. The inclusive campaign images can be seen online and in stores, marking the first time the brand has represented different types of women and the collection is currently available at select Victoria’s Secret stores and VictoriasSecret.com.</p><p id=content-paragraph-2>The female-founded lingerie brand, Bluebella, is all about inclusivity, self-love, individuality, and acceptance, which is why it was a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>perfect choice</a> to team up with Victoria’s Secret, especially since VS has been under fire for the comments made by former CMO of L Brands and Senior Creative at VS, <strong>Ed Razek</strong>. Back in November 2018, Ed was interviewed by <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Vogue</a> magazine and when asked if he would ever use transgender and plus-size models in the VS Fashion Show, he replied, “No. No, I don’t think we should. Well, why not? Because the show is a fantasy. It’s a 42-minute entertainment special. That’s what it is.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Once the comments were made, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Victoria’s Secret</a> was under fire, while the annual fashion show was canceled, eventually leading Ed Razek to retire in August 2019. Since leaving the company this summer, changes have been put into play and according to our sister site, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>WWD</a>, the new CEO, <strong>John Mehas,</strong> spoke at the Investor Update Day at L Brands, (VS parent company) headquarters in Columbus, Ohio in September. “We are taking time to evaluate the right marketing strategy going forward,” he said. “We will be bringing our brand values and heritage to life through a refreshed brand experience that celebrates Victoria’s Secret as a brand by her, for her.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ali-tate-victorias-secret-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>“A lot of the marketing changes just recently happened,” John went on to say. “You’ll start to see an evolution. But for us, it’s being very thoughtful about this precious brand that’s been built over the course of 30, 40 years.” The brand definitely has been making headway, considering they hired <strong>Valentina Sampaio</strong>, an <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>openly transgender</a> model born in Brazil, back in August.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlpZH5xe5BpZq%2Bhk6m8s7XArGSsnZOnsrV5z6WsrGWjnsemedOrmKerl5q7pbHRZqSonJWhwG6uy66cm52coa5ur8Cmp5qhl6N8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
