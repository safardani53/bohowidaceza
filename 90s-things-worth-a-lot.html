Many of your fave '90s toys, shirts, VHS tapes, and other memorabilia are worth a surprising amount of money. From Polly Pockets to AOL disks, here's why you need to call your mom and thank her for not throwing out your crap.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">1. Pokemon Cards</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Not all Pokemon cards are equal, but if you have a few rare ones, or if you caught them all and are willing to sell your entire collection, you can definitely make back some serious cash. Recently, on eBay, a massive collection of Pokemon cards sold for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$200</a>. Specific rare ones can sell for even more, like this one that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sold for $54,000.</a></p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">2. Crystal Pepsi</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>If you have a couple of disgusting 20-year-old bottles of the original Crystal Pepsi just sitting around, you can be making serious bucks. A really gross-looking bottle of the 1993 soft drink is currently selling for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$119 </a>on eBay, and another for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$90</a>.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">3. Polly Pockets</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Today's Polly Pockets are nothing like the original. After Mattel purchased the brand in 1998, the tiny dolls ballooned in size, and they discontinued production on many of the tiny houses and pocket-sized playsets. Therefore, any pre-1998 produced Polly Pocket is now a collectible. On eBay, someone sold their massive collection for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$2,700</a>. Other sold listings range from $200 to $600, even ones without the original packaging.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">4. Old '90s Magazines</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>If you saved every issue of Sassy or Disney Adventures, you finally have a reason to justify your hoarding. There are tons of listings both on eBay and Etsy of people selling their magazine collections for $100 to $300. Recently, a lot of 141 issues of Cracked magazine <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sold for $200.</a></p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">5. Spice Girls Dolls</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>If you've kept all five of your Spice Girls dolls and, most importantly, never removed them from their boxes, you can easily sell them for $100 to $400, depending on the set. Out-of-box dolls, unfortunately, aren't worth all that much.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">6. Disney VHS Tapes</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>OK, now this one is a little iffy. It's been widely reported that classic Black Diamond editions of Disney movies are worth thousands, but the whole thing <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">is an internet hoax</a>. Unfortunately, most Disney VHS tapes aren't worth much, and you can easily find a used copy of The Little Mermaid for $10. However, because the "old Disney tapes are worth thousands" rumor just won't die, many sellers have taken advantage of this by charging insane amounts for used Disney tapes. In fact, a copy of Beauty and the Beast<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> recently sold on eBay</a> for $4,750. If you too want to take advantage of gullible buyers with way too much money, knock yourself out.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">7. AOL Floppy Disks/CDs</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Remember back in the stone ages when we needed AOL to log into the internet? To gain users, the company would send floppy disks and CDs that promised "100 free hours" of internet. What a bargain! If you kept all those annoying CDs and disks (which AOL would send constantly), you might have a collector's item on your hands. Although they're not worth hundreds of dollars, some recent listings have sold for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$45</a> to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$26.</a> Not bad for something you didn't even pay for.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">8. Vintage Band T-shirts</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Vintage T-shirts have been trending in the fashion world for a while. After all, that's why Kim Kardashian<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> pays $1,000 for hers</a>. However, if you have a bunch of original band tees just sitting in your closet, you can totally take advantage of the Kims of the world. On eBay, someone sold their old 1992 Sonic Youth T-shirt for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$450</a>, and someone sold their Janet Jackson tour shirt for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$400.</a></p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">9. 'Baby All Gone' Doll and Accessories</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>These weird little dolls, which have been discontinued by the manufacturer, are a hot collector's item among doll fanatics. The doll by itself is currently selling for around $30, but weirdly enough, it's the doll accessories with the most value. A listing for a bunch of used accessories recently sold for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$60</a>! Not bad for some used junk you didn't even purchase yourself.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">10. Michael Jordan Chicago Bulls Jersey</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>If you have an authentic jersey produced in the '90s, they're currently worth $300. However, some have sold for as much as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$600.</a></p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">11. 3DO Console</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>In the '90s, there was nothing worse than being the kid stuck with a useless 3DO instead of the more popular Sega Genesis. But now it's your time to get the last laugh. The Panasonic console is now <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">worth the same amount</a> as a brand new Playstation 4. Even the games by themselves are selling, with one listing of games <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">selling for $1,000.</a></p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">12. Stamps</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Having a stamp collection probably didn't make you popular in school, but at least you can now profit off the infamy. Books of '90s U.S. stamps are usually valued around <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$100 or more</a>, especially if you have dozens of them.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">13. Yearbooks (If You Went to School With a Celebrity)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Went to school with Taylor Swift? Or how about Beyonc√©? If you still have your old yearbook with their dorky picture in it, you can sell it for hundreds of dollars. A yearbook that featured Bradley Cooper recently <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sold for $250</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">14. Beanie Babies</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>And of course, no listing would be complete without these. Even in the '90s when they first became popular, they were already a bit of a collector's item. Today, certain rare Beanie Babies sell for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">thousands.</a> If you don't own any of the "special" ones, you can sell your entire collection for a cool <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$700 easily.</a></p><p>BRB, cleaning out my garage.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaJ6pnnxzfJBxZmpoX2eGcH2ssGuCfl9ufbR506Ggp5%2BjYsSwvtOhZJplnKTB</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
