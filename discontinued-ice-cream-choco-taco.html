CHOCO TACO</h2><p>Last year, customers went into a frenzy trying to find the last few <a href=#>Choco Tacos</a> after <a href=#>Klondike gave it the ax</a> in July.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="read more on discontinued items">read more on discontinued items</h2><p>The treat had been around for nearly 40 years, earning a huge fanbase.</p><p>Klondike stated to&nbsp;<a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">CNN</a>: "We know this may be very disappointing.</p><p>"Over the past 2 years, we have experienced an unprecedented spike in demand across our portfolio and have had to make very tough decisions to ensure availability of our full portfolio nationwide."</p><p>Fans loved the taco shell-shaped waffle cone that was stuffed with vanilla and fudge-swirled ice cream, topped with nuts, and dunked in chocolate.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Money</h2></p><h2>2. FLINTSTONES PUSH-UP POPS</h2><p>Many of us can still remember the delicious orange sherbet and the fun packaging that kept us, mostly, mess-free.</p><p>These pops became insanely popular after Nestle rebranded them to feature everyone's favorite prehistoric family.</p><p>Themed flavors like <a href=#>Yabba-Dabba-Do</a> Orange, Lime Rock Lime, and Bedrock Berry were a huge hit for kids and adults alike.</p><p>While Fred, Wilma, and Barney are long gone from the packaging, you can still buy <a aria-label="Nestle Push-Ups (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Nestle Push-Ups</a> in new flavors. including Cherry Blast, Turbo Grape, and Outrageous Orange.</p><h2>3. CANDY CENTER CRUNCH</h2><p>For those of us who couldn't decide between a candy bar or an ice cream, this solved our problem.</p><p>The Good Humor ice cream bar featured a chocolate center wrapped in vanilla ice cream, dipped in a chocolate and crispy rice coating.</p><p>Although it's long gone, you can request the item on Good Humor's <a href=# aria-label="website (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">website</a> and let the company know you're hoping for a comeback.</p><h2>4. BUBBLEGUM SWIRL</h2><p>Another gem from Good Humor was the Bubblegum Swirl, which looked just as good as it tasted.</p><p>The pop had blue and pink swirls and tasted just like a gumball, but you didn't have to worry about it running out of flavor.</p><p>If you'd like to relive just a little bit of the nostalgia, you can buy one of the decals that were on the side of the ice cream truck on <a href=# aria-label="eBay (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">eBay</a> for just $7.</p><h2>5. SPRINKLERS</h2><p>This may have been the most simple but delicious ice cream bar available.</p><p>It was vanilla ice cream dipped in chocolate and covered in what seemed like a billion sprinkles.</p><p>In hopes of getting Sprinklers back, fans started a <a aria-label="petition (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">petition</a>, which earned more than 1,300 signatures.</p><p>"These were my favorite growing up and I would give anything to bring them back," one person wrote.</p><p>Another added; "I’m 32 now and literally just asked my sister where this stuff went. So I Googled it and hell yea we need these again."</p><h2>GOOD NEWS COMING</h2><p>There are still some new ice cream innovations being made every day.</p><p>Last month, <a href=#>Baskin-Robbins</a>&nbsp;revealed the <a href=#>Chick’n & Waffles</a> ice cream flavor.</p><p>There is no real chicken in the ice cream, but you'll still get the great savory taste combined with the sweetness of buttermilk waffles.</p><p>The ice cream comes on top of crispy chicken- and waffle-flavored bites drizzled in a “decadent” bourbon maple syrup flavored swirl.</p><p>“This flavor is a frozen twist on the iconic brunch dish, recreated in a deliciously deconstructed concept that is unique to our shops," Hannah Suits, Director of Brand Marketing for Baskin-Robbins, said in a statement.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Walmart also recently launched an unusual ice cream flavor and fans had <a href=#>mixed reactions</a>.</p><p>Plus, see the classic that's making a comeback at <a href=#>Carvel</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57zKilnrFfbIR6f5JqcGicmaiwsLrToqWunZRitqSxjJypnpmdYrCpu8KoZK2Zk6R8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
