Of course, the followers came through.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Chris Evans Has Had the Saturn Tattoo for a While</h2><p>A follower tipped Deuxmoi that the actor does, in fact, have a tattoo of Saturn on his left collarbone. They even shared a screenshot of Evans smiling at the camera wearing a black t-shit.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The t-shirt just covered half of Evans' Saturn tattoo, or in other words, showed half of his ink.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><strong>An anonymous source talked about&nbsp;Chris Evans'&nbsp;Saturn&nbsp;tattoo&nbsp;</strong>(Source: Instagram)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>However, in contrast to the rumors suggesting that the Captain America star got the ink recently, the user noted that the tattoo had been there since 2021. We did some digging of our own, and it checks out.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>The actor has had the tattoo on him for no less than four months as of this writing.</p><p>Reportedly, Evans once shared that Saturn was his favorite planet. So, all things considered, the tattoo might not be related to Baptista after all. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJuYp7a0ecSvmKerXaiutcHRp2StmaSpvLB6x62kpQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
