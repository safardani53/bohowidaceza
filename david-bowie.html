Their son, <strong>Zowie Bowie</strong> (now a film director known as <strong>Duncan Jones</strong>) was born on May 30, 1971. The couple got divorced in Switzerland on February 8, 1980. David is currently married to Somali-American model, <a href=#><strong>Iman</strong></a>, whom he married in 1992. The pair has one daughter together,&nbsp;<strong>Alexandria “Lexi” Zahra Jones</strong>, who was born in 2000. Throughout David’s career, there have been some questions of his sexuality. He declared himself gay in an interview in 1972 and later, in 1976, announced he was actually bisexual. Seven years later, David recanted, claiming that his public declaration of bisexuality was “the biggest mistake I ever made” and that he “was always a closet heterosexual.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGianqSVl3ylrdWim2aan6y2pns%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
