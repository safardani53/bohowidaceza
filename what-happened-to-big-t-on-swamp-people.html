What's truly scary is that it seems to have stemmed from a seemingly benign cut he had suffered in his foot.</p><p>However, the problem grew and grew, and it turned into an infection that then spread to his bone. That's when the gator hunter began to experience a potentially life-threatening situation.</p><p>The reality TV personality shared photos of the damage the infection caused to his foot on social media, and the photos were pretty graphic. Unfortunately, because he didn't have health insurance, a GoFundMe was set up in his name to help crowdsource cash to help cover his medical bills.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Thankfully, strangers, fans of the show, and even some of his co-stars came to his aid.
