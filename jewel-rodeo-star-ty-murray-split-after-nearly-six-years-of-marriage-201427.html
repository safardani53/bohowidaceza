The singer announced the news <a href=#>via her official blog</a> on Wednesday, July 2.</p><p>"Dear World. It is infinitely strange to write those words, especially considering the personal nature of the topic, which is the purpose of my writing today. But the truth is I have lived my life in the public eye since I was nineteen. And while it is intimidating to live a life in the public, it has also been a privilege to make a living with my words, my thoughts, my feelings," the 40-year-old wrote.</p><p>"Which brings me to this highly personal announcement today," she continued. "My husband, friend and partner of 16 years and I have decided to get a divorce."</p><p>"Ty and I have always tried to live the most authentic life possible, and we wanted our separation as husband and wife to be nothing less loving than the way we came together," she added. "For some time we have been engaged in a private and difficult, but thoughtful and tender undoing of ourselves. Allowing ourselves the time and space to redefine what we are to each other with love rather than malice."</p><p>With that, the pair "both value growth" despite enduring this "heartbreaking" step in their lives.&nbsp;</p><p>"Lastly, a message from us both," she concluded. "Our dedication to our son is unwavering and we are both committed to being the best partners in raising our son," she wrote. "Due to the spirit in which we have gone about this separation, we trust we can remain dear friends who hold each other in high esteem, which is so important to us as parents- as we wish only what is best for our son." (The <a href=#>pair welcomed son <strong>Kase</strong></a> in July 2011.)</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The "Foolish Games" entertainer and Murray, 44, secretly eloped to the Bahamas in August 2008.
