I know he [allegedly] beat and abused her pretty bad. I don’t care what the occurrence is; you just don’t put your hands on a woman. I can help, and and it’s the right thing to do for her and for battered women elsewhere. People should always try to help whenever possible.”</p><h3><a href=#>Christy Mack’s Recovery: A New Kind Stranger Offers To&nbsp;Help</a></h3><p class=p1>Such a great attitude! Christy is in good hands — Dr. Toscano has treated celebrity patients like the&nbsp;Real Housewives Of New York and even&nbsp;<strong>Hillary Clinton</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>George W. Bush</strong> while he was serving in the Navy!</p><p class=p1>“I don’t know the extent of the damage, but from what I hear she has a couple of teeth knocked out and pieces of her jaw are broken,” said Dr. Toscano.</p><p class=p1>“Christie is a beautiful girl and she had a very stunning smile and we need to restore that and it will be quite pricey but whatever it is it doesn’t matter.”</p><h3>Christy Mack: Procedure To Fix Her Teeth Would Regularly Cost Upwards Of $75,000</h3><p class=p1>The procedure, which regularly costs upwards of 75 thousand dollars, could take longer than a year. “It depends on if she needs implants and reconstruction and bone grafts and then those take approximately&nbsp;4–6 months to heal. It can take upwards of a year for her to get her smile back which is very debilitating to her psyche.</p><p class=p1>Dr. Toscano is not sure when he’ll be able to start work on her teeth, however — “It will all be dependent on when she gets out of the hospital and what medical rehab she needs to do first so that she is ready to get on a plane and fly to New York so I can work on her.”</p><p class=p1>Christy tweeted the following on August 12, thanking Dr. Toscano for his offer:</p><p id=content-paragraph-2>I would also like to thank <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>@DrToscanoDDS</a> for offering his services in fixing my teeth. I appreciate your support for all victims of abuse.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>— Christy Mack (@ChristyMack) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>August 13, 2014</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-4>However, as mentioned above, Dr. Toscano is not the only one reaching out to help. Fellow porn star <strong>Kendall Karson</strong> set up a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>GiveForward page</a> in order to raise the $100,000 that will be required for Christy’s eventual facial reconstruction surgery. As of this writing, with 90 days left, Christy’s fans and well wishers have already donated over half of the amount needed.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>There are several bounties out on War Machine’s head, including from&nbsp;Pawn Stars‘&nbsp;<strong>C</strong><strong>orey Harrison</strong>, who&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>has put up a&nbsp;10 grand reward</a>, and <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>sex toy company Fleshlight has put up $5,000</a> of their own for any information which leads to the capture of War Machine.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>We’re so glad that so many people are rallying behind Christy and we hope that justice will be served.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7><strong>—&nbsp;Maxine Studebaker</strong></p><h3>More Christy Mack&nbsp;News:</h3><li><a href=#>Dog The Bounty Hunter Was Threatened By War Machine</a></li><li>Christy Mack: MMA Ex Made Rape Joke Months Before Alleged Attack</li><li>Christy Mack & War Machine Together 3 Weeks Before Beating</li><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlkZH15e5BtZpygop7AtcWMppico12nsqS71Z6psmWenrCpu8uaqmasn6iworrOZpuepqSewLV5xaKvoqaXYreiw44%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
