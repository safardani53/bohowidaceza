The <a href=#>social media</a> user said: “Let me tell you, it is the biggest waste of time – do not bother.</p><p>“I think it might even take longer, I don’t get it. I can’t be like you TikTok girlies – why have I done this?!”</p><p>She rounded off the video by saying that all she wanted was a “super cute staircase” but she feels like she just got “a bad back and 100 hours of my life I’m never going to get back.”</p><p>Yet Nerrisa went on to reveal that now she’s half way through the painting process, she “is going to persevere” and hope that the finished results are worth it.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>But before she signed off, she added one final warning: “Do not follow the trends that you see on TikTok unless you are very, very down for putting in the graft.”</p><p><strong>Fabulous will pay for your exclusive stories.
