"You have such a beautiful, silky quality to your tone and I appreciate you for making us all push our buttons."</p><p>In actuality, Maroon 5's Levine pushed Green's button for him, which he later used as leverage: "I pushed two buttons!" Levine reiterated, eventually convincing Lucca to join his team.</p><p>It wasn't until Lucca left the stage that Aguilera realized they both appeared on Disney's Mickey Mouse Club in the early '90s. Feeling embarrassed, Aguilera jumped out of her seat and headed backstage to find Lucca.</p><p>"You know who that guy was? I was on the Mickey Mouse Club with him. That is so weird!" Aguilera told her fellow coaches. "Where is my old Mouseketeer buddy?"</p><p>Once she located Lucca backstage, Aguilera squealed: "Oh, my God! I didn't even recognize you. How are you? And no hard feelings!"</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"<strong>Britney</strong> [<strong>Spears</strong>] had the biggest crush on you," Aguilera revealed. "She'd talk about you all the time — and she wouldn't mind me saying that. Back together on TV! Hello? Does it get better than that?"</p><p>The Voice continues Monday at 8 p.m. EST on NBC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJqhqpmowaq6wGaYoK2ZobKzrYyrnK6mmamytHnWoquhZZ2esKyx2GakqK2jmnqkuNSbqmasn6PGbrjUnJqaZZ%2BjerW0xGatqKGTmnpzfJBrbWtn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
