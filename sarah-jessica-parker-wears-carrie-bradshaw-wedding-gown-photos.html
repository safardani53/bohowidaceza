In photos seen below, she stunned in the bold, beautiful, and big wedding dress she originally intended to marry her on-again, off-again love interest, Big (<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Chris Noth</strong></a>), in. As fans know, the extravagant wedding was called off after Big got cold feet, but the pair eventually reunited and married with simple courthouse nuptials.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/sarah-jessica-parker-recycles-wedding-dress-splashnews-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>Carrie did change how she accessorized it, though, switching out the traditional long wedding veil she once wore with it for a sophisticated and bejeweled mesh veil that covered her face and wrapped under her extra-large hair bun. The teal feathers she wore in her hair with the original veil made it into the new look, however. It’s not clear why Carrie put her wedding dress back on. The scene will likely not serve as a flashback because the outfits differ. Perhaps, the outfit recycling is (SPOILER ALERT) Carrie’s way of dealing with the loss of Big.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/sarah-jessica-parker-recycles-wedding-dress-splashnews-embed11.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>As fans recall, Big died during the first season of And Just Like That after suffering from a heart attack following a Peloton workout. Big’s sudden death in the show followed Chris’ firing after <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>he was accused of sexual assault</a> in 2021.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>However, Carrie is not left heartbroken and alone forever. In the February season finale, Carrie lets her emotions take over and stole a kiss from her co-worker Franklyn, who is portrayed by <strong>Ivan Hernandez</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/sarah-jessica-parker-recycles-wedding-dress-ec-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>The new photos came after more filming shots were released on Thursday by <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE</a> that showed Carrie jumping out of the way from a cyclist who nearly ran her over on the bustling streets of the Big Apple. Sarah took to her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> on Nov. 2 to show off the outfit she wore in the heart-racing scene, which consisted of pieces from Vivienne Westwood, Pierre Cardin, and more name-brand designers. “Carrie’s version of blue suede shoes,” she captioned the gorgeous <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>snapshot</a>, in which she was wearing teal suede shoes by Italian designer <strong>Duchessa Gardini</strong>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>It’s certainly nice to get a peek at the upcoming season of And Just Like That, but fans will have to be patient before Season 2 is available; It’s expected to drop during the summer of 2023.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ye49sZqyZopa1brbErKqim5FivaK%2Byp6pZq%2BVlr%2B0ecKaqauhlWKvs63DrJ%2Bar12ssqWwyKeeZp%2BfrLtuvMeoq6irXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
