It is not.</p><p>The reality, of course, is that outside of a very few places — places like Japan — "whiteface" is not a problem.</p><p>The reason that blackface is so horrific and offensive is not because someone put on too much makeup — it is tied to the history of the practice.</p><p>White men used to put on performances in which they would wear blackface and then act and speak in a way that ridiculed real black people.</p><p>(And if you see someone in blackface today, the odds are pretty good that they’re aiming to make fun of someone, not making an attempt at flattery)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>In history, blackface wasn’t just rude — it was a racist instrument of oppression.</p><p>What came to be called "Jim Crow laws" were named after one such blackface character.</p><p>Blackface represents a history of people of privilege punching down.</p><p>Whiteface, in America, has no such power because no one in the U.S. is marginalized for being white.</p><p>Again, there are places in the world — like Japan — where whiteface can be offensive because the history and dynamic is different.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>It seems safe to say that Spice didn’t bleach her skin just to prove a point.</p><p>That would be a weird thing to do for a song in which she sings about loving the strong melanin of her skin.</p><p>Instead, we’re going to go out on a limb and say that she’s wearing a whole lot of makeup.</p><p>She is parodying the way that some people — including people within her own community — seem to believe that she should look.</p><a href=#><img width=500 height=500 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg alt="The Hollywood Gossip" decoding=async sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 40px), 720px" data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2 class=block-title>Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta Cast Photos</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pwX2Z9cLjOr5xmmZ6Zeqm1z2afqKhdlsGtrc2tmGarpJa%2Fbr%2FPopqeZZeawbR50qWYpqWVmXqnu9FmrqGhpJqzoq%2FEaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy;
