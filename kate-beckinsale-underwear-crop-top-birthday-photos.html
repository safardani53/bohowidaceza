The British bombshell celebrated her 49th trip around the sun with a cheeky post via Instagram on Saturday, July 30. Standing on a couch in front of balloons spelling out her name, the Underworld actress rocked a pair of black underwear, a crop top with the band Clash’s logo and a set of knee-high black leather combat boots. A second snap caught her mid-air as she jumped on her friend lying on the couch, which she captioned, “Previously on Love Island.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>The big birthday comes after the beauty sparked romance rumors with <strong>Jason Momoa</strong> after they <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>looked quite cozy</a> at an Oscars after-party in March. The Aquaman star even wrapped his jacket around the actress as they chatted outside. However, Jason quickly shot down the speculation that the move was anything but a friendly gesture. “It was cray,” Jason told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Extra</a>, regarding the dating rumors. “Have a conversation with a woman about her country…I was in England doing&nbsp;Aquaman 2. Everyone is like, ‘Are you dating?’ No, no. It was chivalry, the woman was cold.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>He insisted that he and Kate are “absolutely not together,” but added that the actress is “very nice.” He explained, “I was being very nice, just being a gentleman. Now I’m not giving my coat to anyone!” Of course, the rumors had gained momentum because Jason and his now ex-wife, <strong>Lisa Bonet</strong>, announced that&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>they were separating</a>&nbsp;after 17 years together and five years of marriage.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Meanwhile, Kate has been gushing about her daughter <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Lily Mo Sheen</strong></a> and the 23-year old’s burgeoning film career. The ingenue, whom Kate shares with ex <strong>Michael Sheen</strong>, recently starred alongside <strong>Nicolas Cage</strong> in&nbsp;The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent. However, Kate makes sure not to avoid the stage mom trappings. “I’m not calling her up and saying, ‘Now, I’ve got a pearl of wisdom, get ready!’” she told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>ET&nbsp;</a>in Oct. 2021.&nbsp;“It’s been very important to me to be very independent in that respect.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH14e5JqZqSZpJp6o7HCpKCnq5Ghsm7BzZ2cq6%2BVlr9ur9Gop2asn6V6o7XRrZ%2Bdmalivam706iqaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
