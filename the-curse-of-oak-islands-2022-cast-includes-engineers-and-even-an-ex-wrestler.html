A legend says the island is hiding one of the greatest treasures in the world but no one has found it yet.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><p>Hence The Curse of Oak Island sees the Lagina brothers – Rick and Marty – trying to solve the mystery with their band of treasure hunters.

The duo hail from Michigan and have become well-known reality stars over the years.</p><p><strong>Rick and Marty</strong></p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">History.com</a> notes that Rick Lagina is a retired postal worker from Northern Michigan. Despite his line of work being starkly different from treasure hunting, he has dreamed of solving the Oak Island mystery since the age of 11.</p><p>As a youngling, Rick had read about the Oak Island mystery in the January 1965 issue of Reader’s Digest. Now, at the age of 70, Rick still continues his quest to unearth the riches.</p><p>Younger brother Marty, on the other hand, is an engineer who owns an energy company. Given his scientific background, Marty is highly skeptical of whether there’s something hidden on the island.</p><p><strong>Craig Tester</strong></p><p>Craig is Marty’s former college roommate and current partner in the energy business. The engineer is an expert in drilling and resistivity.</p><p>Craig was actually an ex-wrestler and even defeated some good wrestlers back in the day, as per <a href=# rel=nofollow>Famous Face Wiki</a>. However, he chose not to pursue it professionally and became a successful businessman instead.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">History.com</a> says: “Don’t let his calm, cool and collected demeanor fool you. With a wrestling background, he’s not one to mess with.”</p><p><strong>Gary Drayton</strong></p><p>Gary is a self-taught expert in metal detecting, who has helped Rick, Marty and their team unearth some of Oak Island’s most magnificent finds such as coins, semi-precious gems and also a 14th Century Lead Cross.</p><p><strong>Alex Lagina and Jack Begley</strong></p><p>Alex is Marty’s son while Jack is Craig’s stepson. Both Alex and Jack are integral members of Fellowship of the Dig. Like his dad, Alex has an engineering background.</p><p>On the other hand, Jack is one of the keenest members of the fellowship. He is interested in everything from clue-finding to drilling and digging to unearth something.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/26/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-07-at-8.17.12-AM-1024x550.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=how-many-episodes-of-oak-island-season-10-have-aired>How many episodes of Oak Island season 10 have aired?</h2><p><a href=#>The Curse of Oak Island </a>season 10 premiered on November 15.
