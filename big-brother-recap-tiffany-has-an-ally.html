Da’vonne argued with him in public that she was not the one who told him.&nbsp;</p><p>Tiffany knew Da’vonne was lying because Da’vonne was the first person she asked about creating the alliance. This is when Tiffany realized she had no one in the house and set off to the have not room to have a cry.&nbsp;</p><p>Frank went in and chatted with her and they made the most unlikely alliance in Big Brother history, but Da’vonne walked in and crashed the party.&nbsp;</p><p>Nicole went to the room after Frank left, but Tiffany made it very clear she knew the reason Nicole was there, so Nicole got up and stormed back out of the room.&nbsp;</p><p>Tiffany then went and met Da’vonne&nbsp;in another room and things got confrontational. Zakiyah stormed in to find out what the heck was going on, but Tiffany just wanted to make it clear that she isn’t an idiot.&nbsp;</p><p>After Zakiyah stormed off, Da’vonne forced Tiffany to take a break from the game and let all of her emotions out because it’s going to ruin her game.&nbsp;</p><p>Tiffany agreed and the two of them made a deal.&nbsp;</p><p>Paulie made it clear to his alliance members that they made a mistake keeping Tiffany and that he wouldn’t make the same mistake again this week. They all agreed with him.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Paulie nominated Tiffany and Natalie for eviction.</strong></p><p>Tiffany and Frank were conspiring straight away and Tiffany realized she needed to shake the foundations of Paulie’s alliance, so she made it her mission to win the Road Kill.&nbsp;</p><p>The unthinkable happened and she actually managed to eke out a victory over her fellow houseguests.&nbsp;</p><p>She informed Da’vonne that she was putting Corey up and to keep her mouth shut about it. Da’vonne&nbsp;kept it zipped in case she was put up instead.&nbsp;</p><p>At the Road Kill ceremony Corey laughed when he was put up. It was like he figured it all out in that instant.&nbsp;</p><p>Is there a chance that Tiffany could really survive another week?</p><p>Hit the comments below!</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>14 Most Toxic Relationships in Reality TV History</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2puX2WEcK7IoGSbqp%2Bptaa%2BjKucnJmgYsGqssWapbJlmJbAbq3NZpilpKlk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
