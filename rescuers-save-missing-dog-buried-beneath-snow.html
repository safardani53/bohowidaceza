His owner — a traveling nurse — was forced to evacuate during the fire leaving him unable to search for his missing canine.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"He was very cold and scared and tired, and it was a trying trek coming down the hillside with five feet of snow," Wendy Jones, the executive director of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Tahoe PAWS and TLC 4 Furry Friends</a>, told PEOPLE of the daring rescue. "It was freezing temperatures, and it was getting dark. I'm sure this dog has an adventure to tell."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy Tahoe PAWS</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In December, a skier reported spotting Russ in the snowy Sierra Nevada mountains.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Washington Post</a>, after Russ growled at the skier, the man snapped some photos and posted them on Facebook, describing his encounter with the trapped dog.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">That post caught the attention of Jones, who is based in South Lake Tahoe, Calif. Although she was in the middle of another rescue, she reached out to fellow rescuers Leona Allen and Elsa Gaule to help save Russ amid subzero temperatures.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We knew time was [of] the essence because the dog had been out in the snow all day. And we knew how cold it was. So it was pretty intense, pretty emotional, a lot of adrenaline," Jones recalled to The Post.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Armed with snowshoes, a sled, and dog rescue equipment, the two-woman team trekked up the mountain to rescue the pup they had never met.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I followed the tracks and all of a sudden saw this dark shape under the tree and thought this isn't good he's not moving and thought to get really nervous and really upset," Allen told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>KOVR</a>. "And then he opened his eyes, and I'm pretty sure I screamed. I'm pretty sure Elsa heard me down the mountain."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The sweetest thing on the planet. Just the most amazing dog," added Allen.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I kind of petted him under the chin a little bit, and he did that thing where a dog rests his head in your hand," recalled Gaule. "We're just like, he's here. Okay, what's next? We didn't really think about that. And then I look over at Leona, and I said, 'How do you feel about riding down on a sled with him on your lap?'"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Once the pair earned the dog's trust, they were able to transport him down the mountain in a two-hour-long return trek.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy Tahoe PAWS</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"They put him on one of the volunteer's laps to keep him warm and to keep him from trying to take off," Jones said to PEOPLE.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Russ, who "was in pretty good health," was turned over to El Dorado County Animal Services and checked out by a veterinarian once he reached the bottom of the mountain.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The combination of a missing dog report filed in August and a microchip made it possible for animal services to track down Russ's owner in Riverside County, Calif. The dog dad "assumed that Russ had been lost for good," according to a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Tahoe PAWS Facebook post</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"He [the owner] was ecstatic," Jones told PEOPLE of the happy reunion that took place the day after Christmas.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She urges pet owners <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>to microchip their animals</a> and keep those microchips updated with current contact information. Jones also recommends equipping pets with collars that include name tags with contact info.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Speaking to the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>San Francisco Chronicle</a>, Allen admitted, "I've worked some pretty gnarly rescues, this probably being the top. I keep reliving the moment when he opened his eyes and lifted his head, and just the joy and elation inside of me was overwhelming. It's one more life that gets to live happy and warm and safe."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Those interested in making donations to the Tahoe PAWS and TLC 4 Furry Friends nonprofit can do so by visiting their <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>website</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6CawbR70Z6qnK2Vp8Buv8CvnGalmajAqrrGZpuon12XwrO1xJ1km52emq61tIyspaivXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
