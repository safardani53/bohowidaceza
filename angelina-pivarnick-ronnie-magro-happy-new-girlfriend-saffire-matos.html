Now that the two are over for good and he’s moved on to a much more low key and less drama filled relationship with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Saffire Matos</strong></a>, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Angelina Pivarnick</strong></a>&nbsp;says that she’s thrilled that he “seems really happy” in his life again in an EXCLUSIVE interview with <strong>HollywoodLife.com</strong>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>“Ron was always the person who was all over social media with the drama. I’m really happy for him now that that’s not the case,” Angelina tells us. The 35-year-old’s Instagram is now filled with various promos for Jersey Shore, videos with his cast mates, loving snapshots of him with Ariana and the two photos he posted <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>debuting Saffire as his new lady</a> in late Oct. 2020.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Angelina-Pivarnick-Ronnie-Magro-new-girlfriend-mega-post1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>“He seems really happy. That’s all I want for him. He’s my brother and I’m really happy for his future. I’m happy that he’s staying out of the drama and the tabloids. I just hope it stays like this. Whenever Ron’s happy, I’m happy. That’s all that matters,” Angelina continues.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Ronnie debuted a photo of Saffire via his IG on Oct. 27, showing him lifting her up with her legs around his waist while kissing aboard a boat off of Puerto Rico.&nbsp; He was seen smooching the bikini clad beauty, and it caused pal&nbsp;<b><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Mike “The Situation” Sorrentino</a>&nbsp;</b>to respond in the comments by cheering, “Taken Ronnie.” Fans then went wild when he responded back to the Mike by writing, “lmfaooo bruhhhh stable Ronnie.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Stability is what Ronnie had needed so badly with a woman after his drama filled relationship with Jen. During their time together, She allegedly&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>tried to run him over</a> with a car, there were back and forth <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>accusations of domestic violence</a>&nbsp;and fights that left&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Ronnie with a black eye</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Ronnie then shared a second IG photo holding Saffire and wrote in the caption, “You can’t force happiness, when you know it’s real you realize it eventually chooses you! #HappinessIsAGift #ThankFul.” Angelina says, “He’s definitely happy. Ron has changed for the better.” She’s also gushing over what a wonderful dad he is to Ariana.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>“I saw him on a Zoom call with his daughter recently and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>he’s such a good dad</a>. I really look up to him for that. I’m not a parent yet, but I look at that and I’m like…you could be in your darkest days and you have a child and that child pulls you out of it. He always says, ‘I did this all for my daughter,'” she reveals to us.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>Angelina even thinks Ronnie could be the next cast member to get married, following <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>her Nov. 20, 2019 nuptials</a> to <strong>Chris Larangeira</strong>. “He’s a perfect example of changing you life for the better. So that’s why I look up to him. I’m really happy for him. Maybe he’ll be the next one <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>to get married</a>. You never know!” she teases.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpgZH5ze5BvZpqml5q5qrrAZqeirpGnu6qvymapqKaenrJuucCgqahlmJa9scWMp5ywZZeev62y0aKcp5xdqK6nssirnGalkam8tHs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
