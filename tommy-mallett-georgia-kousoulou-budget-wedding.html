It was unreal. It is so me and <a href=#>Tommy</a>. I literally got back, got my PJs on straight away and we had a Chinese.&nbsp;</p><p>“The best bit about it was that we hired tables. So we had a top table…And we all just stuffed our faces with Chinese … it was actually brilliant. So good.”</p><p>She continued: &nbsp;“All of it is filmed, you will get to see everything. When we started the series it wasn’t in the plan. In genuine Georgia and Tommy fashion that is what they ended up getting in the end. It was unbelievable. . .”</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on Tommy Mallett">Read More on Tommy Mallett</h2><p>At the time, the couple announced the <span id=c907f533-09d6-46a9-bd67-e9f8fee8b81a class=suggested-link>news</span> with a picture of them newlywed alongside son Brody.</p><p>They wrote: "1st December… we done a thing.</p><p>"After a challenging year. We decided we wanted to end the year happy, in love & together as husband & wife.</p><p>"Wedding part 2 coming soon."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in TV</h2></p><p>They are also still planning to hold a biggest ceremony abroad in 2025. Filming wrapped last month and fans don’t have to wait long to watch the wedding because of the show’s very fast turnaround.</p><p>Georgia said: “We finished filming about a month ago. It is filmed as things were happening.</p><p>“Otherwise it feels stale…yeah it is out quite quick. It was a really good series. I was dreading it a bit. I just didn’t know if I had the <span id=e677140c-ac7e-4f94-9de9-431e59499987 class=suggested-link>energy</span> for it.</p><p>“It is hard. We have always stuck to give the good, bad and ugly. It is amazing to watch but it is hard when you do that every series. It would be <span id=26983e80-82f5-4d26-8dc4-016e47cff276 class=suggested-link>nice</span> to sit and have a series where we just talk about stuff. That is not us anyway. But it does take its toll. It ended lovely. So that was good.” &nbsp;</p><p>Georgia and Tommy Baby <span id=3b28f1bd-fb7c-4c87-a020-db1ab6c4edbf class=suggested-link>Steps</span> airs on Sunday at 9pm on <a href=#>ITVBe</a> and <a href=#>ITVX</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/tommy-mallett-georgia-kousoulou-ref-558329850.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2taGplZ39zhJRsZq2nnaLGbrnApaOerKRitKa70aCgmmWbpMK0u9Slpq5lkqqxqLHTZq6enJSeu6h7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
