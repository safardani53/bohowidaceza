Brynn and Blake had been off and on for years, [so] to portray Kendall as some sort of homewrecker is just out of bounds.”</p><p>The source adds that “it’s incredibly disappointing for Blake that a private family matter is now out in the public” and that “he is foremost concerned about his children.”</p><p>As previously reported, Cameron, 31, who shares 4-year-old son Ford and 1-year-old daughter Finely with the 28-year-old basketball player, <a href=#>filed the suit</a> because of his alleged “refusal to provide promised financial support to Cameron pursuant to their oral agreement that she would give up her career goals and aspirations to raise their children and support Griffn’s career,” according to the court docs.</p><p>The former couple — who met in 2009 — welcomed their first child together in August 2013 and their second was born in September 2016. According to the court documents, the pair planned a wedding for the weekend of July, 28, 2017, in St. Barts, but a month before the wedding, Griffin insisted Cameron sign a prenuptial agreement that “contradicted their prior oral agreement, including denying her meaningful support and her share of their property in event of a divorce.”</p><p>Cameron, however, “stood firm” and refused to sign the prenup, which postponed the wedding with only one week’s notice, according to the court papers. They later attended couples therapy, but according to Cameron’s allegations, Griffin “immediately embarked on a high-profile affair with Jenner.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“In about August 2017, after humiliating his family by sending a very public weekend with Jenner in the Hamptons when he told Cameron he would be in Oklahoma, Griffin informed Cameron he had no intention of continuing to lie with her and their children,” the court documents continued.</p><p>Us Weekly <a href=#>first reported</a> that the 22-year-old Keeping Up With the Kardashians star and Griffin were hooking up in September. The reality star has been spotted multiple times cheering on the former Rookie of the Year. She most recently <a href=#>sat courtside</a> at his January 24 game amid breakup rumors.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGahp6dir62typ5koKqZm7OqutJmp5qkmaK8r8WMrKyirF2ewG6txZ%2BcnKyZo7Rus8Vmop6mlJa5rXnJnqWnnaJk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
