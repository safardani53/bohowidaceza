After all, they provide the only contact between the car we’re driving and the road surface.</p><p>"In an extreme situation, correctly inflated tyres with good levels of tread will allow all the other safety systems on a car to work at their most effective.</p><p>"Inadequate tread or incorrect pressure mean one thing: the safety systems on your vehicle will not work as efficiently. That's why regular checks on tyre inflation and tread depth are so important."<br></p><h2>Can I be fined for driving with bald tyres?</h2><p>If you drive without enough tread depth on your tyres, you could be fined £2,500 per tyre that is found to be defective.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">READ MORE ON DRIVING</h2></p><p>Because this is for every wheel, this adds up to a maximum financial penalty of £10,000.</p><p>And with three penalty points possible per tyre too, you could also end up with a ban.</p><p>Most of the time, tyre tread depth offences are dealt with at the roadside.</p><p>The penalties here are lower - £100 and three points.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">READ MORE IN THE SUN</h2></p><h2>How much tread depth should my tyre have?</h2><p>The law states that cars, light vans and trailers must&nbsp;have at least 1.6mm of tread across the central three quarters of the tyre and around the entire circumference.</p><p>Motorcycles and large vehicles have a minimum depth requirement of 1mm, with mopeds just needing to show a visible tread.</p><p>This is in addition to testing all tyres are correctly inflated as per your car manufacturer's instructions.</p><p>Worn or under-inflated tyres reduces a vehicle's ability to grip onto the road, in addition to compromising handling. This puts tyres more at risk of blowing out.</p><p>You also need to be careful not to over inflate tyres, as it will increase stopping distances and reduce grip.</p><p>This is because the tyres have less surface contact with the road, which in turn will cause more wear on the central part of the tyre - meaning they have to be replaced sooner than expected.</p><p>Beyond a monthly check of tyre tread and pressure, it's also recommended to test both before a long journey.</p><p>You can easily check whether a tyre has enough tread by using the 20-pence test.</p><p>If the rim or border of the 20p is not visible when inserted into the groove of a tyre, it is within the legal depth limit.</p><h2>How often should I replace my tyres?</h2><p>Around <a href=#>1.4million Brits are driving with at least one tyre that is classified as illegal</a>, according to a recent study by the Confused.com site.</p><p>Most of the time, your tyres should last around 20,000 miles. This is how far it takes to wear new tyres down to a potentially hazardous level.</p><p>But the law covers the tread depth of the tyres rather than their age, so if your tyres have worn more quickly then you still need to replace them.</p><p>Experts recommend replacing tyres when the tread is worn down to below 3mm.</p><p>But critics say it's a waste of money and that <a href=#>1.6mm is enough</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqamraeiqHx4f5hubG9qX5u2r7HDZpuroaaeu6h5wZqjnWWkrr%2Bmv4ytqZ6ZlGKxprzToWSrrZyawHA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
