It has gifted me so much.</p><p>"It has been the most extraordinary training ground as an actor where I’ve been given the chance to grow and learn. I’ve had the honor of working with so many inspiring and talented people. It provided new opportunities, such as directing and it has bonded me to such incredible fans that have supported me along the way.

As is the nature of our jobs I needed to seek out new challenges, and new opportunities and carve out a new chapter for myself. I have been so lucky to be a part of something so awesome for so long but I hope you can understand and respect my choice to further expand and grow. I wouldn’t be here without you all and I am so grateful.</p><p>"I had a lot of conversations over the years with our showrunners&nbsp;@goldbergian&nbsp;and&nbsp;@andrewchambliss&nbsp;and I think we found a fitting way to conclude Alicia’s story. It is beautiful, hopeful, and elusive."</p><p>She concluded: "To the crews and casts from Los Angeles to Vancouver, Mexico to Texas, I am thankful for everything you’ve taught me. I love you all so much and I am so lucky to have had you all by my side. To the cast going forward, I’m so excited for what you will create next!</p><p>"And to my ride or dies who have been there with me every step of the way (you know who you are), I will be forever grateful to you.
