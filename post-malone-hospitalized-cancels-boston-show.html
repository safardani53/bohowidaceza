The rapper, 27, revealed he’s having some health challenges via Instagram after cancelling his Boston show at the TD Garden on Saturday, Sept. 24. “Boston, I love y’all so f—— much. On tour, I usually wake up about 4 o’clock PM, and today I woke up to a cracking sounds on the right side of my body,” he began in a message posted to his Twitter account. The message came just a week after he was also hospitalized in St. Louis after bruising his ribs after he fell into a hole on stage at the Enterprise Center.</p><p lang=zxx dir=ltr><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pic.twitter.com/EKhpn97Xil</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-3>— Post Malone (@PostMalone) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>September 24, 2022</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-5>“I felt so good last night, but today it felt so different than it has before,” the Syracuse, New York native went on. “I’m having a very difficult time breathing, and there’s like a stabbing pain whenever I breathe or move.
