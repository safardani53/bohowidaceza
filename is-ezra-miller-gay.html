Superman: Dawn of Justice, Suicide Squad, and others.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Have you guys seen the recent images of Ezra Miller? He began to wear eye makeup with short mini dresses.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>His makeup and attire lead everyone to wonder about his real identity.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>And here is the truth: Ezra Miller is not a gay man but a queer man. He came out as gay when he was 12 years old.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>But “queer” is mainly associated with a pejorative term, and queer people have more feminine features. They also belong to the LGBTQ community.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Ezra Miller publicly revealed his non-binary identity in the media and discussed his sexual identity.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>“Queer just means no; I don’t do that.” I don’t identify as a man. I don’t identify as a woman. “I barely identify as a human.”</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>As a result, Ezra Miller asked that the media use the pronouns they, them, it, and zir.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>But it is not like Ezra is attracted to one gender of people alone; he has expressed his interest in both men and women.</span></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Ezra_Miller_Polyamorous></span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Is Ezra Miller Polyamorous?</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>We only recently discovered that Ezra Miller is queer, but there are examples to show that he is a member of the polycule community.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>First, “polyamorous” means having intimate relationships with more than one person simultaneously. A polyamorous person might have or be open to having multiple romantic partners.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>And it is utterly different from polygamy.</span></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_are_the_Proofs></span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>What are the Proofs?</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.nextbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Ezra-Miller.jpg><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Ezra Miller is the person behind the world’s popular #metoo movement.</span></p><p>And he even raised his concern about an anonymous Hollywood director and producer who mistreated him even though he was just an underage kid.</p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>That kind of treatment gave him a deep wound in his memories of Ezra, making him abandon monogamy and opt for polyamory.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>After entering the polycule community, Ezra Miller explained that</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>And then they are in the squad—the polycule.

He stated that.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>“I’m trying to find queer beings who understand me right off the bat as a queer being.”</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>This shows that Ezra Miller is looking for queer people. However, if we look at his previous relationships, he has dated a few women.</span></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Ezra_Miller_Ex-Girlfriends></span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Ezra Miller Ex-Girlfriends</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>When he was just 12 years old, Ezra Miller dated Esther. It was just a brief infatuation, and the couple broke up after dating for a few months.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Then Ezra Miller began dating Zoe Kravitz, an American actress and the daughter of Lenny Kravitz, a famous actor, and musician.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The relationship didn’t last for many years.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Then after that, Ezra Miller dated Lauren Nolting, who is an American photographer.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In 2013, he dated the woman Erin Urb, and the couple got engaged in 2014, but even that relationship didn’t last.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>They separated in 2016 because one spiritual adviser told Ezra Miller that Erin was a parasite.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>No one wants to marry a parasite, right? But when did humans become objectified as parasites?</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>But there are no present details about the relationship status of Ezra Miller, and yes, he has even gotten engaged to a woman, as we told you earlier.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Ezra Miller is a Queer man who became interested in women.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;Next Read:&nbsp;<a href=#>Is Austin Butler Gay?
