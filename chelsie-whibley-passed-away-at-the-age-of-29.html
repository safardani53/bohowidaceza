Her husband, Glyn, acknowledged her death in a poignant message on his Facebook page.</p><p>Glyn Whibley said in an earlier statement on Saturday:</p><p>“It is with great sadness that I must notify everyone that our darling precious Chelsie died away this afternoon at 2.45 pm.”</p><p>The former actress was best known for her roles as Fern in CBBC’s Dani’s House and Rebekkuh in Sadie J.</p><h2>Chelsie Whibley’s cause of death</h2><p>Chelsie Whibley died as a result of a heart attack. The late 29-year-old was outspoken about her life-threatening condition, cystic fibrosis (CF), which she recorded on her YouTube channel, “My CF Life.” Whibley died on Saturday afternoon as a result of complications from her CF. According to her husband, Glyn, the Denmead, Hampshire resident was brought to the hospital as her difficulties worsened. Chelsie Whibley’s health “took a swift turn for the worst and (she) became unresponsive,” according to Glyn.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Chelsie-Whibley-2.jpg alt="Chelsie Whibley" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>She was transferred to Southampton General Hospital and died at 2.45 p.m. Glyn described her death as “short” and “painless.”&nbsp;Whibley died as a result of her hereditary illness, cystic fibrosis, which damages the lungs and causes various respiratory issues. The condition thickens the mucus in the lungs, which ultimately plugs the organ’s pore, lowering its operating ability.&nbsp;CF is known to induce extra lung issues such as bronchiectasis (airway scarring), recurrent lung infections, decreased respiratory capacity, pulmonary failures, and more. Meanwhile, it may spread to other organs such as the liver, pancreas, intestines, and others.</p><h2>The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation states that.</h2><p>“Data also reveal that half of the fatalities recorded in the Registry in 2019 happened before the age of 32, known as the median age of death.”</p><p>Chelsie Whibley suffers from Cystic Fibrosis.&nbsp;The 29-year-old was diagnosed with a “suppressed immune system” as part of her condition, according to the Daily Mail UK. This indicates her lungs were working at a significantly lower level than what is deemed ideal. Whibley’s lung function, according to the study, was “25 percent (of) their usual capability.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Chelsie-Whibley-3.jpg alt="Chelsie Whibley" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>As previously said, Chelsie Whibley came up about her disease on her YouTube channel and displayed her experience with CF in the thick of the epidemic. Whibley uploaded a video in 2016 in which she stated her hope for a future cure for her disease. She stated:</p><p>“There is currently no cure for cystic fibrosis, but that does not rule out the possibility of one in the future. Because I’m sure there will be… I can feel it in my bones. It will happen, maybe not right now, maybe not tomorrow, maybe not in ten years, but it will happen.”</p><p>Chelsie Whibley’s husband Glyn, mother, and other close family members survive her.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiaoZ2cqLamedahoJukla56sa3SrJydZZGsrrp5wK1kraCVYq6osYyonWZqaWQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
