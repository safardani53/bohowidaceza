We also meet the entire team that makes Mimi’s luxurious life possible as the singer simultaneously majorly plays up her living legend status in one boudoir ready ensemble dripping in diamonds after the next. But even when flustered by personal issues and dance routines, the singer proves she’s forever ready for her close-up.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">RELATED PHOTOS: Photographic Evidence Mariah Carey Is Never Not Glamorous</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While you could easily make GIFs of every single fashion moment that took place over the course of this first hour installment, here’s a few of our personal favorites.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Taking a Dip in Diamonds and Silk</strong></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-low-res"></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After slipping on the stairs of her private yacht and letting out a little squeal, Mariah says, “That’s what I do when I’m about to fall, I just scream into a high note.” She then decides to “have a splash,” saying, “Oh, the agony! I’m on a yacht and I have to go on a swing in diamonds and a dress,” adding, “Whatever, this is perfectly normal and everyone does this.” Everyone definitely does not do this.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>She Puts Her Shoes on Two Assistants at a Time</strong></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At one point, she has two assistants on the floor attempting to lace her into a complicated pair of heels, while saying, “It is taking me a minute to put these shoes on. They always have to get so cute and then they can’t go on right.” But she quickly realizes she shouldn’t complain about shoes other people are strapping to her feet, adding, “Oprah told me, ‘Don’t let anybody think that you don’t know how to put your shoes on anymore.’ And she’s really right. The problem is, these shoes are abusive and I can’t put them on alone. I’m not going to lie about it.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>A Little Tiara Never Hurt Anyone</strong></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-low-res"></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While trying on the wedding gown for her big day, the designer suggests that perhaps a tiara is what’s needed to make the whole nuptial look complete, to which Carey responds “just a little tiara.” As though the pop star has ever gone for anything understated.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>She Doesn’t Trifle with Fluorescent Lights</strong></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When she shows up for a 10 p.m. dance rehearsal, the pop star is displeased with the lighting situation, quipping, “I have a rule that I will not be seen in fluorescent lighting without sunglasses. It’s very ’90s of me.” And also completely on-brand.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>The Return of Bianca Storm</strong></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-low-res"></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Of course, no Mimi documentary would be complete without the return of her alter ego/arch nemesis Bianca Storm i.e the singer herself in a brunette wig. But even though Storm originally appeared in her 1999 music video “Heartbreaker,” as Mariah would likely say of her own worst enemy, “<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>I don’t know her.</a>”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>What did you think of the first episode of Mariah’s World?
