But just because it’s laid-back it doesn’t mean it can’t be special. Barbecues have come a long way since a couple of burnt sausages and a packet of frozen burgers!”</p><p>Here, Tom shares some of his favourite meals for cooking over flames and hot coals.</p><ul><li><strong>Outdoor Cooking by Tom Kerridge (Bloomsbury Publishing) is out now, £22.</strong></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/NINTCHDBPICT000655672554.jpg><h2 class=has-text-align-center>The ultimate hot dog</h2><p class=has-text-align-center>These hot dogs are based on everyone’s favourite Christmas side: pigs in blankets. Like Christmas trees, hot dogs are thought to originate in Germany, so I’ve added a bit of curry powder, German mustard and Bavarian cheese as a nod to that. Great to cook outside on a cold day!</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>Serves 4</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/NINTCHDBPICT000655669853.jpg><p><strong>YOU NEED:</strong></p><p><strong>For the barbecue-burnt onions:</strong></p><ul><li>2 large onions, finely sliced</li><li>3 tbsp vegetable oil</li></ul><p><strong>For pigs in blankets:</strong></p><ul><li>4 jumbo sausages</li><li>2 heaped tsp mild curry powder</li><li>12 rashers of streaky bacon</li><li>For the German mustard mayo:</li><li>100g thick mayonnaise</li><li>40g German mustard</li><li>3 tsp finely chopped shallot</li><li>10 cornichons, finely sliced</li><li>2 tbsp finely chopped dill</li><li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</li></ul><p><strong>To assemble:</strong></p><ul><li>4 long hot dog rolls</li><li>8 thick slices of smoked Bavarian cheese</li><li>8 large slices of dill pickle</li><li>A bunch of spring onions, green part only, finely sliced</li></ul><p><strong>METHOD:</strong></p><li>To cook the onions, place a cast-iron pan on the hot barbecue and add the oil. When it is hot, add the onions with a generous pinch of salt. Stir well and cook for about 20 minutes until softened, dark and caramelised.</li><li>Meanwhile, prepare the sausages. Poke a metal skewer through the length of each sausage and lay the skewers on a tray. Season with the curry powder, trying to get an even coating all over the sausages. Wrap each one in bacon, using 3 rashers per sausage, and secure the bacon with a couple of cocktail sticks.</li><li>Lay the bacon-wrapped sausages on the hot barbecue and cook for about 10 minutes, turning every minute or two. While they are on the barbecue, mix the German mustard mayo ingredients together in a bowl, seasoning with salt and pepper to taste; set aside until needed.</li><li>Once the sausages are cooked through, lift them off the barbecue and place on a tray. Remove the cocktail sticks and metal skewers.</li><li>To build the hot dogs, slit the rolls open through the top and lay the cheese slices in them. Add the bacon-wrapped sausages and top with plenty of caramelised onions and the pickle slices.</li><li>Place the hot dogs on a sturdy baking tray on the barbecue, put the lid on and leave for a minute or two so that the cheese becomes all gooey and melted. Transfer the hot dogs to plates and spoon on the German mayo. Scatter over the spring onions for freshness and serve.</li><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Smokey prawns cooked in foil</h2><p class=has-text-align-center>This no-hassle, no-mess dish is perfect for prepping ahead and sticking on the barbie as everyone arrives. The prawns steam-cook wrapped in foil, which locks in moisture to keep them juicy. Get people round the table as you undo the parcel – to savour the incredible garlicky aroma.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>Serves 4</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/NINTCHDBPICT000655669825.jpg><p><strong>YOU NEED:</strong></p><ul><li>600g large raw tiger prawns</li><li>100g butter</li><li>4 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</li><li>5 garlic cloves, thinly sliced</li><li>1 long red chilli, sliced</li><li>1 tsp sweet smoked paprika</li><li>80ml dry sherry</li><li>Salt and freshly ground pepper</li></ul><p><strong>To finish and serve:</strong></p><ul><li>2 tbsp roughly chopped flat-leaf parsley</li><li>Crusty bread</li></ul><p><strong>METHOD:</strong></p><li>First, peel the prawns, removing the heads but leaving the tail shells on. Using a sharp knife, make a small slit along the middle of the back to expose the dark intestinal vein. Prise this out with the tip of your knife and discard it.</li><li>Tear off a 45cm length of foil and place shiny side down on your work surface. Fold the foil in half, then create a pocket by sealing the sides (to do this, fold the foil edges over and over a few times, pressing firmly). Put the prawns into the foil pocket through the opening at the top.</li><li>Put the butter, olive oil, garlic, chilli, smoked paprika and sherry into a small pan. Place over a high heat and let it bubble away for 2 minutes. Take off the heat and season well with salt and pepper.</li><li>Pour the butter over the prawns in the foil pocket. Fold the foil edges together along the open side to seal the parcel completely. Place the foil parcel on your hot barbecue and cook for 12–15 minutes, depending on the heat. You’ll be able to tell that it’s nearly ready when the envelope begins to puff up with steam.</li><li>Remove the foil parcel from the barbecue, open it up carefully and tip the prawns and buttery juices into a serving bowl then sprinkle with chopped parsley – or just rip it open, throw in the parsley and tuck in! Make sure there’s lots of crusty bread around to dunk in the juices.</li><li><strong>TIP:</strong> Instead of a foil parcel, you can cook the prawns in a sealed rigid foil container – for better stability.</li><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Coleslaw with radish and spring onion</h2><p class=has-text-align-center>No barbecue is complete without a good slaw. Of course, there’s nothing wrong with buying coleslaw, but it’s easy to make your own. This version includes radishes, which give it a peppery kick that’s enhanced by the mustardy mayonnaise dressing.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>Serves 4</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/NINTCHDBPICT000655669868.jpg><p><strong>YOU NEED:</strong></p><ul><li>1 red onion</li><li>1 Spanish onion</li><li>10 radishes, thinly sliced</li><li>¼ white cabbage, tough core removed</li><li>A bunch of spring onions, finely sliced</li></ul><p><strong>For the dressing:</strong></p><ul><li>80g mayonnaise</li><li>1 tbsp English mustard</li><li>1 tsp cracked black pepper</li><li>A good pinch of salt</li></ul><p><strong>METHOD:</strong></p><li>Slice the red and Spanish onions very finely and place in a large salad bowl with the sliced radishes. Shred the white cabbage finely and add to the bowl.</li><li>For the dressing, in a small bowl, mix together the mayonnaise, mustard, cracked pepper and salt.</li><li>Add the dressing to the cabbage mix and toss well to coat everything evenly.</li><li>Then scatter over the spring onions, toss again and your coleslaw is ready to serve.</li><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Courgette and halloumi skewers</h2><p class=has-text-align-center>I love cooking halloumi on the barbecue. It caramelises beautifully on the outside but doesn’t melt – perfect for kebabs! The salty flavour and firm texture work so well with grilled courgettes, which are a barbecue staple for me. A chilli and mint dressing gives the skewers a fresh lift.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/NINTCHDBPICT000655669862.jpg><p><strong>YOU NEED:</strong></p><ul><li>3 x 225g packs halloumi</li><li>3 medium courgettes (500g in total)</li><li>2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</li><li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</li></ul><p><strong>For the chilli mint dressing:</strong></p><ul><li>3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</li><li>1 tbsp sherry vinegar</li><li>1 tbsp red wine vinegar</li><li>1 long red chilli, deseeded and finely diced</li><li>2 tbsp finely chopped mint leaves</li><li>1 tsp dried mint</li></ul><p><strong>To assemble:</strong></p><ul><li>16 short wooden skewers, 12cm long. Pre-soak them in water for 30 minutes to avoid scorching on the barbecue.</li></ul><p><strong>METHOD:</strong></p><li>Cut the halloumi into 1cm batons. Do the same thing with the courgettes.</li><li>Skewer a piece of halloumi onto each pair of skewers, placed parallel to each other 3-4cm apart, then thread a courgette baton on.</li><li>Repeat until you have at least 3 pieces of halloumi and 3 courgette batons on each pair of skewers.</li><li>For the chilli mint dressing, put all the ingredients into­ a bowl, mix well to combine and season with salt and pepper to taste; set aside. Brush both sides of each skewer with the olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper.</li><li>Place on a medium heat on the barbecue and cook for around 3–4 minutes on each side. Once the halloumi is a lovely golden-brown colour, they are ready to remove from the heat.</li><li>Pile the courgette and halloumi skewers onto a warmed serving plate and spoon over the dressing. These are best served with a green salad on the side.</li><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Stuffed sweet potatoes</h2><p class=has-text-align-center>Take baked spuds to new heights with these coal-cooked sweet potatoes filled with soured cream, chives, bacon and melted cheese. They become soft and even sweeter as they cook in their foil parcels, absorbing all that lovely smokiness.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>Serves 4</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/NINTCHDBPICT000655669855.jpg><p><strong>YOU NEED:</strong></p><ul><li>4 medium sweet potatoes</li><li>2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</li><li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</li></ul><p><strong>For the toppings:</strong></p><ul><li>1 tsp sweet smoked paprika</li><li>120g cheddar, freshly grated</li><li>6 slices of thick-cut smoked streaky bacon (optional)</li><li>4 heaped tbsp soured cream</li><li>8–10 chives, cut into 1cm lengths</li></ul><p><strong>METHOD:</strong></p><li>Tear 4 pieces of foil, each large enough to wrap a sweet potato. Using a fork, pierce each sweet potato all over then place one in the middle of each piece of foil. Drizzle with the olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Rub the sweet potatoes well so they are evenly coated, then wrap in the foil.</li><li>Place the foil-wrapped potatoes on the grid of a hot barbecue and cook, turning them regularly; they will take around 45–50 minutes depending on their size. You can tell when they are cooked by pressing them down with your tongs – if they feel softened, they are ready. Remove them from the barbecue and open up the foil.</li><li>Make a cut along the middle of each sweet potato and push the two sides slightly apart.</li><li>Sprinkle the exposed potato flesh with the smoked paprika and grated cheese. Keep the sweet potatoes in their foil and pop them back on the barbecue, then close the lid for a few minutes to melt the cheese.</li><li>Meanwhile, if you’re happy with a non-veggie version, barbecue the bacon until browned and crispy on both sides; remove and chop roughly. If the cheese still hasn’t melted, pop the lid on the barbecue for a few minutes.</li><li>Remove the potatoes from the barbecue and place on a serving tray. Spoon on the soured cream, add the bacon pieces if using and sprinkle with the snipped chives. Serve straight away.</li><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Barbecued Chicken Wings Three Ways</h2><p class=has-text-align-center>Chicken wings are a barbecue classic but often they’re smothered in an overly sweet sauce. These three glazes are light, fresh and packed with punchy flavours. Choose one or make all three then pile them high for everyone to dig in. Get those napkins ready!</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>Serves 4-6</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/NINTCHDBPICT000655669865.jpg><p><strong>YOU NEED:</strong></p><ul><li>20 large chicken wings, jointed</li><li>200g table salt</li><li>2 litres water</li><li>10 black peppercorns</li><li>4 bay leaves</li></ul><p><strong>For the Korean-style glaze:</strong></p><ul><li>80ml rice vinegar</li><li>60g caster sugar</li><li>50ml Sriracha hot sauce</li><li>50ml tomato ketchup</li><li>2 tbsp Gochujang chilli paste</li><li>2 tbsp sesame oil</li><li>20g butter</li></ul><p><strong>For the honey soy glaze:</strong></p><ul><li>100g runny honey</li><li>2 tbsp soy sauce</li><li>2 garlic cloves, finely grated</li><li>1 tbsp sesame oil</li></ul><p><strong>For the mustard and maple glaze:</strong></p><ul><li>75g butter, softened</li><li>1 tbsp cider vinegar</li><li>2 tbsp wholegrain mustard</li><li>80ml maple syrup</li></ul><p><strong>To finish:</strong></p><ul><li>2–3 spring onions (green part only)</li><li>Black sesame seeds</li><li>Toasted (white) sesame seeds</li></ul><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Fabulous</h2></p><p><strong>METHOD:</strong></p><li>Brine the chicken. In a large bowl, whisk the salt into the water to dissolve and add the peppercorns and bay leaves. Immerse the chicken wings in the brine and place in the fridge overnight. Remove the wings from the brine and pat dry with kitchen paper.</li><li>To make the Korean-style glaze, put all the ingredients into a pan on the hob, bring to a simmer and cook for about 5 minutes, then take off the heat. For the honey soy glaze, whisk all the ingredients together in a bowl and set aside. For the mustard and maple glaze, melt the butter together with the cider vinegar, mustard and maple syrup in a pan over a low heat. Stir to combine; keep warm.</li><li>Place the chicken wings on a hot barbecue and cook for 10–12 minutes until slightly browned on each side, turning at least once. Now glaze each third of the wings with one of the glazes. Cook for a further minute or so, then turn and glaze the other side. Cook, turn and glaze the wings for another 3–4 minutes until slightly charred.</li><li>Remove the chicken wings from the barbecue and place them on a warmed tray. Brush generously with extra glaze and leave to rest for a minute or so. Meanwhile, finely shred the spring onions.</li><li>Garnish the Korean-style chicken wings with the black sesame seeds and shredded spring onion. Sprinkle the honey soy glazed wings with toasted sesame seeds. (Leave the maple and mustard glazed chicken wings plain.) Let everyone help themselves.</li><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Michelin-starred chef Tom Kerridge shows how to cook the perfect poached egg</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e8Wopp1nYWp9eYSYb3BorJ%2Bieqyx0augnZ%2BVYr%2Bmr8ipnKxlkpe%2Bbq%2FOqKJmmpGjuG60zqWgnZmpZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
