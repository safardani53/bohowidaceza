While only 9 years old at the time of her father’s death, Lisa Marie would go on to follow in her father’s musical footsteps by releasing a solo rock album titled To Whom It May Concern in 2003. The record proved successful, and she would follow it up with 2005’s&nbsp;<i>Now What</i>&nbsp;and 2012’s&nbsp;<i>Storm & Grace</i>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>The singer and songwriter sadly passed away at 54 on Jan. 12, 2023, her mother confirmed in a heartrending statement. “It is with a heavy heart that I must share the devastating news that my beautiful daughter Lisa Marie has left us,” Priscilla confirmed in a statement to&nbsp;AP. “She was the most passionate strong and loving woman I have ever known.

He wants to do his own thing and I’m really proud of him,” the actress said, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Closer</a>. “He doesn’t want to step into the spotlight, and he’s always been that way. He’s not riding on Elvis and he’s not riding on Lisa. We have never been, ‘Elvis this, Elvis that,’ to our children because otherwise, you’re building up something that is almost unreachable for them.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>On February 15, 2022, Navarone <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>married&nbsp;</a>his girlfriend <strong>Elisa Achilli</strong>, 22, after dating for four years.
