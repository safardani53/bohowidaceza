Tarek, her husband, is supportive of the adjustments.</p><p>She stated:</p><p>“My body is changing, and I’m clearly not accustomed to it.” I can see myself nude now, and I can see my tummy and other parts of my body growing. I can’t wear bras anymore, and I can’t button my pants. I’ve outgrown a lot of my clothing, and it’s a difficult transition.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Heather-Rae-El-Moussa-2.jpg alt="Heather Rae El Moussa" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The star of Selling Sunset went on to say:</p><p>“I went from being really little to simply see my body transform and getting accustomed to it.” And he’s [Tarek] always so upbeat, telling me how lovely I am and how great my physique is.
