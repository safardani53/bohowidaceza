Soompi’s translation:</p><p>“I didn’t realize my body was in agony during the shooting. I assumed it was just burnout. It was the first time I was nervous about going on-site.

I felt very sorry for the director and my seniors. “I even sobbed after shooting because I felt sorry.”</p><h2>Park So-dam, the Phantom actor, discusses her present health situation and the many methods she takes care of herself.</h2><p>Park So-agency dam’s announced in December 2021 that she had been diagnosed with papillary thyroid carcinoma and had had surgery.
