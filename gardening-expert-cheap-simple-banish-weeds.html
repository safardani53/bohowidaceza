Use Lemons to Kill The Weeds</h2><p>The gardening whizz points out you can easily kill weeds with something as simple as a <a href=#>lemon</a>.</p><p>"Simply cut a lemon in half and then squeeze the juice over the weed," she says.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Fabulous</h2></p><p>"The citric acid in the lemon should kill the weed within a few days."</p><p>The gardening guru goes on to say how this method is especially effective when there's strong sun shining on the weeds.</p><p>"The lemon juice can be used as it is, there is no need to dilute it," she continues.</p><p>"Alternatively, you can get some powdered citric acid and mix this with water in a spray bottle.</p><p>"Then, simply spray the weeds with the solution."</p><h2>3. Use Salt to Kill The Weeds</h2><p>According to Fiona, salt can also be effective at killing weeds.</p><p>"Sprinkle some salt liberally over the weed and leave it there," the gardening pro says.</p><p>"This should kill off the weed within a few days."</p><p>Fiona goes on to say how salt is also great for deterring insects and slugs, but warns: "Be careful not to sprinkle the salt on the surrounding lawn and this could kill off some of the grass."</p><h2>4. Use Eco-Friendly Weed Killers</h2><p>The gardening whizz also points out that while many weed killers can be quite toxic and dangerous, there are now many eco-friendly weed killers available to buy.</p><p>"These solutions usually come in a spray bottle and tend to be relatively cheap to buy," the gardening guru says.</p><p>"Simply spray the solution directly onto the weed and leave it to do its thing.</p><p>"These eco-friendly weed killers will usually kill off the weeds within a few days."</p><h2>5. Use a Vodka Solution</h2><p>For weeds that get a lot of sunlight, Fiona suggests using a vodka solution made from 1 part vodka and 2 parts water.</p><p>"Add a couple of drops of liquid dish soap to the solution," she says. "Put this solution in a spray bottle for easier application.</p><p>"Spray the solution directly onto the weed and this will dry the weed out and kill it off."</p><p>However, she warns: "Be sure to avoid spraying the solution on the surrounding grass as it'll also dry out your grass and make it look quite unappealing."</p><h2>6. Use Boiling Water</h2><p>The gardening guru also believes that boiling water is a great way to help kill off weeds.</p><p>But she says to avoid getting the boiling water on the surrounding areas of grass as it could cause some damage.</p><p>"Boil some water in the kettle and take this outside," she explains.</p><p>"Then, pour the boiling water directly on the weed. This will cause the weed to burn up."</p><h2>Bargain Weed-Killing Products</h2><p><strong>Vitax SBK Ready to Use Tough Weedkiller 1L</strong></p><p>According to Fiona, this weed killer, which can be bought for just £5 from Wilko, is "perfect for eliminating a wide range of weeds including docks, brambles, nettles, and tough weeds."</p><p>She explains: "It kills both the weed and the root so the weed doesn’t grow back.</p><p>"It's fast and convenient and the formula has the added benefit of being safe for grass, so wandering sprays won’t affect your lawn."</p><p><strong>Spear & Jackson Xtra Tough Weed Killer 1L</strong></p><p>Fiona points out that this £4.29 weed killer, which is sold in B&M, is also great because it "kills both the weeds and the roots."</p><p>She goes on to explain how it's super easy to use.</p><p>"Simply spray over the weeds and it'll kill of the weeds and roots, plus, prevent further growth," she says.</p><p>"This ready to use spray can cover over 30m2 so it’s perfect for typical UK household gardens."</p><p><strong>Bright Spark: Weed Burner With Piezo Ignition</strong></p><p>Sold for just £9.99 in Home Bargains, the gardening pro says this weed killer allows you to burn weeds and destroy their cell structure with the self-igniting piezo system.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>"It has an adjustable flame and ergonomic handle design for safety and ease of use," Fiona explains.</p><p>"If you’re looking for a way to kill off your weeds without any hazardous chemicals, this is a great option."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5FraGlpZm6BcLPAq5ueppmjtG6x16mcq6xdmLWmrc9mqqKloKGybq7Ap6CsoF2ssqaw0mg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
