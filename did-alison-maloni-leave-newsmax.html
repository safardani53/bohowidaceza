Sometimes, it can feel like the second you get comfortable with a lineup for your favorite show, they decide to switch things up, or one of the anchors leaves.</p><p>Regular Newsmax viewers got to experience this recently after Alison Maloni, one of the regular hosts of Wake Up America on the network, missed a show. After she missed the show, many viewers wondered whether Alison might be leaving the network completely, but thankfully, that doesn't seem to be the case.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Did Alison Maloni leave Newsmax?</h2><p>Although she missed the show on Oct. 26, Alison doesn't seem to be going anywhere. It's unclear why she missed that show, but it likely had more to do with some personal reason than her status with the show or the network.</p><p>In fact, Alison and Newsmax are so committed to one another that Alison recently took to Twitter to announce that the format for Wake Up America would be changing.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In response to someone who wondered whether she'd left the network, Alison wrote "Hi! I’m still with the Wake Up America and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@newsmax</a> Team! Stay tuned for a few new segments that I’ll be working on. See you Monday!"</p><p>She went even further on her own Twitter, page, writing: "Exciting news! The Wake Up America team is expanding. I’ll see you on Monday on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@NEWSMAX</a> Stay tuned for new segments I’m working on."</p><p>Clearly, then, Alison is not planning on going anywhere, and it seems like she may have even taken the time off in order to work on the new segments that she'll be piloting. Alison and Newsmax have not divulged exactly what those segments may contain, so viewers will just have to wait and see. Alison promised that she would be returning to the show on Oct. 30, though, so Wake Up America fans should be able to catch her on the channel then.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Twitter/@AlisonMaloni</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Fans are thrilled that Alison is sticking around.</h2><p>In the replies to Alison's announcement, fans weighed in to let her know that they were happy she wasn't going anywhere.</p><p>"Congratulations!
