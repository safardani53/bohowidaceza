It’s that one part that’s a little bit of a mystery to people, but that’s the way we want it,” she explained. “The only way to protect it is not to talk about it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/hannah-davis-derek-jeter-zoom-5c58c152-069e-4f16-85c1-910254bd1d6f.jpg><p><span>Davis, 25, stuns on the cover of the magazine, wearing a tiny gold bikini that barely contains her breasts as she simultaneously flashes Jeter’s impressive sparkler on her ring finger. (The model previously caused a stir when she was the cover girl for the 2015 </span><i>Sports Illustrated</i><span> Swimsuit Issue</span><a href=#> in a tiny bikini </a><span>that left little to the imagination.)</span></p><span class=caption></span><p><span>She and Jeter, 41, </span><a href=#>got engaged this past October</a><span> after dating for more than three years. The thing that made Davis sure that the former New York Yankees star was the one, she told </span><i>Maxim</i><span>, was his values.</span></p><p>“Trying to impress you with material things? I think that’s lame,” she said. “I wanted someone whose family is a big, important part of their life.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/hannah-davis-inside-zoom-9bd614f4-6ec2-47f0-b2c5-8c5ab28acdb9.jpg><p><span>At the time of their engagement, an insider told </span><i>Us Weekly</i><span> that </span><a href=#>the athlete was smitten</a><span> with Davis for more than her good looks.</span></p><p>“Their relationship works because they are both supportive and sweet to each other,” the source told <i>Us</i>. “They almost never fight.”</p><p>And indeed, Davis told <i>Maxim</i> that her own temperament and approach to their upcoming wedding is one of cool calm.</p><p>“I’m not a worrier,” the model said. “There’s no point. My philosophy is to let everyone else worry.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGahmZ6jrql5w5qtoqtdobywt9Jmqp6qmaTCtLjYZqqesKlivK9506GcZpufq7Kzec6fZKaZqJ66bsDApaKsZZGXvLbAjJ%2BgmqaTmnqlsdGeomailamys3nWam1vaGZpfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
