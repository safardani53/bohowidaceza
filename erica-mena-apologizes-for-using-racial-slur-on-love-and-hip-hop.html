I am committed to listening to the voices of those affected and will work toward making amends.”</p><p>Mena went on to claim that she did not intentionally mean to insult costar <strong>Spice</strong>’s race. “As a woman of color and the mother of two black children, I want to make it clear that my use of that word was not in any way racially driven,” she continued. “That said, I do understand the gravity of what I said and want to use my platform to promote inclusivity and equality.”</p><p>Earlier this month, MTV announced that Mena would no longer appear on the long-running series after she referred to Spice, 41, as a “monkey” in a recent episode. “The Love & Hip Hop franchise has never shied away from hard conversations in our community,” read a statement shared via the show’s official <a href=#>Instagram</a> page on September 2. “Working hand-in-hand with our partners, viewers will see the impact of Erica Mena’s remarks play out in the final three episodes of the season. Effective immediately, she will not appear in the next season.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Erica-Mena-Apologizes-for-Using-a-Racial-Slur-That-Got-Her-Fired-From-%E2%80%98Love-and-Hip-Hop2.jpg><p>Mena joined the show in season 7, which premiered in 2018. She previously starred in Love & Hip Hop New York from 2011 to 2015.</p><p>Mena’s argument with Spice began when Spice claimed that Mena’s son King “hates” his own mother. In response, Mena yelled, “You monkey, you f–king blue monkey!”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Mena shares King, 16, with ex <strong>Raul Conde</strong>. She also shares <a href=#>daughter Safire</a>, 3, and son Legend, 14 months, with ex-husband <strong>Safaree Samuels</strong>.</p><p>After the scene played out on TV, Spice told <a href=#>Forbes</a> that she’s trying to move forward. “I’m on my journey to becoming this new woman,” she explained earlier this month, noting that she expects a certain level of drama while filming. “I feel like that comes with what I signed up for. So, I’m good. I’m in a better space right now. It comes with it. You know what the franchise is about. So, it’s OK for me.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJyroZOWeq6xzZpkmqifobyotdmeqmaen6d6tr%2FIp55mqpGYtqK4jKyjrqpdpLtuuM6vnGaZnpl6qbXPZp%2BoqF8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
