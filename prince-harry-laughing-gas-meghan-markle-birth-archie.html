The Duke of Sussex, 38, made the admission in his upcoming memoir&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Spare</a>, which is being released by Penguin Random House on Jan. 10. “Meg was so calm. I was calm too,” he wrote in the memoir per&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Daily Mail </a>of the birth at London’s Portland Hospital.&nbsp;“But I saw two ways of enhancing my calm. One: Nando’s chicken (brought by our bodyguards). Two: A canister of laughing gas beside Meg’s bed. I took several slow, penetrating hits,” he added.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Laughing gas is a colloquial term for nitrous oxide, which is a pain reliever admitted in hospitals during procedures.&nbsp;He explained that the former&nbsp;Suits&nbsp;star “‘bounced on a giant purple ball” while going into labour before taking a bath.

I took several more hits and now I was bouncing too,” he went on, revealing a nurse later came back into the room to use some of the gas for Meghan — only to fine the can was empty. “I could see the thought slowly dawning [of the nurse]. ‘Gracious, the husband’s had it all’…’Sorry,’ I said meekly,” he recalled as the nurse looked over in his direction.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Meghan then received an epidural to help with the pain of her first time giving birth. “The anaesthetist hurried in. Off went the music, on went the lights. Whoa.
