I said, 'Give me three weeks.'&nbsp;</p><p>"I had to lose 16 pounds, down today."</p><p>Kim went on: "It was such a challenge. It was like a [movie] role. I was determined to fit [into] it. I haven't had carbs or sugar in about three weeks.&nbsp;</p><p>Kardashian fans were shocked, slamming Kim's diet as unhealthy.</p><p>But Kim continued slimming down, showing off her new, significantly less curvy figure on social media and at events.</p><h2>KYLIE'S FITNESS JOURNEY</h2><p><a href=#>After</a>&nbsp;<a href=#>Kylie</a>&nbsp;split from&nbsp;<a href=#>Travis Scott</a>, she has been focusing on herself and her fitness.
