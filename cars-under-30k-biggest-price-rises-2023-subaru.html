up 36 per cent</h2><p><strong>Avg Price Dec 2022:</strong>&nbsp;£20,000<br><strong>Avg Price Dec 2023:</strong>&nbsp;£27,275</p><p>When <a href=#>BMW</a> started producing the Z Series in 1989 its modernist look was miles away from the usual BMW styling.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Motors</h2></p><p>The Z, standing for zukunft, German for ‘future’ meant the car was design wise, ahead of its time so perhaps it’s not unexpected its popularity has been on the rise.</p><p>Every one of the six BMW Z Series cars tracked by Hagerty’s rose in value this year.</p><p>The most collectable is the very limited edition Z8, but the Z3 M has also taken off recently &nbsp;with its 90s styling combined with M variant upgrades proving to be a hit with millennials.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Vauxhall Calibra 2.0 8V - up 37 per cent</h2><p><strong>Avg Price Dec 2022:</strong>&nbsp;£1,750<br><strong>Avg Price Dec 2023:</strong>&nbsp;£2,400</p><p>The Calibra was <a href=#>Vauxhall</a>’s answer to the rise of Japanese <a href=#>sports cars</a> that hit the market in the early 1990s.</p><p>The futuristic coupe was famously the most aerodynamic production car on its release in 1989.</p><p>Nowadays though they are extremely rare, with fewer than 500 of all types left on the road.</p><p>That rarity, combined with a low price, has led to a huge percentage rise, which is equivalent though to just a few hundred pounds in real terms.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Talbot Sunbeam Lotus - up 42 per cent</strong></h2><p><strong>Avg Price Dec 2022:</strong>&nbsp;£16,350<br><strong>Avg Price Dec 2023:</strong>&nbsp;£23,275</p><p>In its day, the Sunbeam Lotus was Talbot’s answer to the nippy Fords and European GTi models which were all the rage towards the end of the 1970s.</p><p>It’s had rise in its fortunes lately though thanks to its appearance in the <a href=#>Forza</a> series of <a href=#>video games</a> as well as an appearance on the TV show <a href=#>Bangers and Cash</a>.</p><p>Also marking it down as hot hatch was a ‘reimagined’ version produced by Tolman Engineering which had 242bhp.</p><p>With all the recent interest then it’s not surprising the car has seen a significant rise in price.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Renault 4CV - up 42 per cent</strong></h2><p><strong>Avg Price Dec 2022:</strong>&nbsp;£6,850<br><strong>Avg Price Dec 2023:</strong>&nbsp;£9,475</p><p>While most of the other saloons from the 1950s are decreasing in value, the <a href=#>Renault</a> 4CV is bucking the market.</p><p>It is eligible for the ultra-exclusive Mille Miglia retrospective event and it has a very keen following by collectors in <a href=#>France</a>.</p><p>Those collectors have been splashing the cash as a few, very unusual and valuable versions have come on the market including both Découvrable (convertible) and Barquette (open-top sports) models.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Ford Escort XR3 - up 43 per cent</strong></h2><p><strong>Avg Price Dec 2022:</strong>&nbsp;£7,700<br><strong>Avg Price Dec 2023:&nbsp;</strong>£10,975</p><p>In the early 1980s the Ford Escort XR3 was the stuff of dreams for any young man.</p><p>It was seen as a working class British hero next to the more pretentious hot hatches coming from European makers like <a href=#>Volkswagen</a> and <a href=#>Peugeot</a>.</p><p>That attraction hasn’t diminished either and in August a sub-1,000-mile XR3 sold for a record £33,750.</p><p>It’s sales like that, that have helped push the price upwards.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Citroen CX - up 43 per cent</strong></h2><p><strong>Avg Price Dec 2022:</strong>&nbsp;£6,825<br><strong>Avg Price Dec 2023:</strong>&nbsp;£9,750</p><p>The <a href=#>Citroen</a> CX has seen a revival in its fortunes lately and is seen now as something of a motoring icon.</p><p>Its sleek design is almost up there with its iconic DS forebear and prices have been starting to shoot up, especially in France with particular interest in the GTi versions.</p><p>In the UK, prices are more affordable but have also been rising particularly for rare versions in good condition.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Lancia Beta Berlina - up 44 per cent</strong></h2><p><strong>Avg Price Dec 2022:</strong>&nbsp;£4,000<br><strong>Avg Price Dec 2023:&nbsp;</strong>£5,750</p><p>A Lancia Beta is a rare sight on British roads at the best of times, with the four-door Berlina a particular rarity.</p><p>While its fastback design was all the rage in the 1979s its blunt front grille makes the Lancia stand out from the crowd.</p><p>Manor Park Classics sold a 1600 Berlina for a hefty £12,938 in October this year, which no doubt helped push the value skyward.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Ford Escort XR3i (MkIII) - up 75 per cent</strong></h2><p><strong>Avg Price Dec 2022:&nbsp;</strong>£7,875<br><strong>Avg Price Dec 2023:</strong>&nbsp;£13,750</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2ctx6x0-modified-mk3-ford-escort-867449278.jpg><p>The Escort XR3i is another Ford which has seen rising interest and prices in 2023.</p><p>Dealers are pushing the values of this model – as well as the later Mk IV – upwards, with the better examples reaching nearly £20,000.</p><p>With the way values of other fast Fords have risen recently, especially the Sierra RS Cosworth, the XR3i's value is predicted to carry on going upwards.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>BMW Z3 Roadster - up 131 per cent</strong></h2><p><strong>Avg Price Dec 2022:</strong>&nbsp;£6,000<br><strong>Avg Price Dec 2023:</strong>&nbsp;£13,850</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/independant-jury-composed-motor-journalists-1119290.jpg><p>The rise in price of the more desirable Z3 M has meant there’s been a knock-on effect of the more standard version.</p><p>But because prices are lower, this has translated into a higher percentage rise – up by 131 per cent over the year.</p><p>Big auction prices paid in Europe haven’t yet been felt here in the UK for the convertible but prices are on the rise.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Subaru Impreza Turbo 2000 -
