The <a href=#>bond between pet owners and their four-legged companions is unique</a>, which is why many stars commemorate their connection with <a href=#>a special tattoo</a>.</p><p class=p1><a href=#><strong>Chris Evans</strong></a>, who<a href=#> frequently dotes on his dog Dodger across social media</a>, did not waste much time after adopting the pup to ink Dodger’s name across his chest.</p><p class=p1>“I mean that’s probably one of the purest relationships I have,” the<a href=#>&nbsp;<i>Captain America: The Winter Soldier&nbsp;</i>star</a> said of his ink during an appearance on&nbsp;<a href=#><i>Jimmy Kimmel Live!&nbsp;</i></a>in October 2020. “It didn’t take much convincing. I’ll never regret that tattoo. I’ve regretted a few in my life, not that one.”</p><p class=p1>Evans has <a href=#>gotten several tattoos that have special meanings</a> ala his Dodger one. “I really like tattoos [although] the problem is when you wear a short-sleeve shirt in a movie, that’s an extra hour in the makeup chair,” he said during a June 2014 interview with <a href=#>The Hot Hits</a>. “It’s just not worth it. I’m all for tattoos but just somewhere they can be hidden.”</p><p class=p1>The Massachusetts native is not the only celebrity to dedicate ink to a beloved pet. <a href=#><strong>Jennifer Aniston</strong></a> got the name of her late dog Norman tattooed on her foot.</p><p class=p1>“My Norman<a href=#> just passed away about a month ago</a>, and I remember thinking I had never walked through having to lose a pet. So just the idea of it,” the&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Morning Show</a>&nbsp;</i>star revealed during a 2011 appearance on&nbsp;<a href=#><i>Inside The Actor’s Studio</i></a>, noting her favorite word was the pooch’s name. “And Norman was&nbsp;getting up there at the time, so, again, easy access.”</p><p class=p1><a href=#><strong>Dave Bautista</strong></a>, for his part, had three of his dogs’ faces marked onto his leg. (Bautista is <a href=#>a proud dog dad to canines Frankie, Penny, Ollie and Maggie</a>.)</p><p class=p1>“Amazing trip [to New York City] where I had the honor of being tattooed by my girl&nbsp;@trudy_lines_tattoo,” the&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Guardians of the Galaxy</a>&nbsp;</i>actor wrote via <a href=#>Instagram</a> in August 2018, debuting his fresh ink. “She gave me the gift of bringing my babies with me everywhere I go. And I can’t explain how happy that makes me. … Have to say though, I’m pretty excited to be going home to my babies.”</p><p class=p1><a href=#><strong>Miley Cyrus</strong></a> is <a href=#>no stranger to getting tattoos</a> either. Through the years, the “Wrecking Ball” songstress has inked illustrations of her l<a href=#>ate dog Floyd, her late blowfish, her sheepdog Emu and pitbull Mary</a>.</p><p class=p1>Cyrus, who has more than 74 tattoos, previously struggled to remember all the art she’s gotten over the years.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“I have no idea [how many],” she said during an appearance on&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Jimmy Kimmel Live!</a>&nbsp;</i>in December 2020. “Um, because [Jimmy,] you probably are much more coherent when I am getting these tattoos than I am.”</p><p class=p1>Scroll below to see which stars have gotten tattoos in honor of their precious pets:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6poJyspaeytHvCnqOemqNixKm7jKCmrWWkp7ajwdOeZK2ZpKm8sL%2BMn6arZaSdsqq%2BjKmcratdmLWztdJmnK%2BZnqh6rrvRnmY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
