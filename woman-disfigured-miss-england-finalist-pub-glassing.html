something Miss Cooke denied.</p><p>Gold today sobbed in court as she was found guilty of unlawful wounding but escaped court.</p><p>Instead, she was handed a suspended prison sentence and ordered to pay Â£7,000 in compensation.</p><p>The beauty contestant needed a total of five stitches to what was described as 'an ugly wound' but went on to compete in last year's <a href=#>Miss England</a> final.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NINTCHDBPICT000503247114.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NINTCHDBPICT000609117074.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NINTCHDBPICT000609116924.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NINTCHDBPICT000503243777.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NINTCHDBPICT000503243776.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NINTCHDBPICT000503243780.jpg><p>However, she missed out on top spot and a place at Miss World.</p><p>She gave evidence at the trial in March and attended Gold's sentencing hearing today, which had been delayed by the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>She told the court: "I have obviously got my back up and got in a verbal argument, trying to stick up for myself.</p><p>"Out of nowhere she chucked her drink on me and I don't know what happened but instantly she glassed me twice towards the head.</p><p>"It was one to break the glass and the second to cause injury, and obviously it has."</p><p>She added: "I feel very angry and upset and I know I will have scars on my face.</p><p>"I am very confused as to why China would do this and disfigure me.</p><p>"Having to look at the scar on a daily basis in the mirror has caused a huge amount of upset and I am sure I will never get over it without plastic surgery."</p><p>The court heard Miss Cooke still awaits plastic surgery to the resulting scarring on her face as well as to repair nerve damage, and was said to suffer from severe stress, anxiety, and depression.</p><p>Miss Cooke, who teaches golf to children, also feared discipline from the Professional Golfers' Association and the Miss World Organisation after they received anonymous calls that she had been in a fight, the court heard.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NINTCHDBPICT000609117075.jpg><p>Gold maintained she had no intention of hurting her and had apologised on seeing blood all over her face.</p><p>"I felt bad. It was instinctual, I didn't go out of my way to do it.....I am just not a horrible person," she told the jury of seven men and five women.</p><p>But on reaching what Judge Philip Statman described as a "fair and just" sentence, he said he had considered mitigating factors including Gold's positive previous good character, her own diagnosed PTSD, the realistic prospect of rehabilitation, genuine remorse, and the current pandemic restrictions within prisons.</p><p>Passing sentence, Judge Statman described Gold as 'fragile' from her own mental health problems and severe depression resulting from being bullied at school.</p><p>But he added that while her attack on Miss Cooke was spontaneous, she had gone 'over and above' any possible lawful self-defence.</p><p>"The red mist descended upon you and you behaved in a way which was wholly unlawful, totally out of character, and led to these serious wounds being inflicted upon your victim," the judge told Gold.</p><p>"Your victim sustained ugly injuries to her face which will leave her scarred but one hopes for the skill of the surgeon.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in News</h2></p><p>"The effect on your victim of your actions have been profound. As a result of what you undoubtedly did she suffered then and continues to suffer."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>But Judge Statman said Gold was considered vulnerable and a low risk of reoffending, had been subject to a six-month curfew while awaiting sentence, and sought psychiatric help.</p><p>He also imposed a five-year restraining order banning any contact with Miss Cooke.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZn94fJVuZ2lnp6S6orqMnaCsnpmcwrOxw2akoqujYrKvs8uapZ1llp67orjIrKtmqKWXeqi4wKyqoqaXZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
