Read on to learn 25 things about the actor.</p><p>1. I eat a bowl of cereal pretty much every night before going to sleep.</p><p>2. I was raised primarily by my Cuban mother.</p><p>3. I hosted an overnight shift on an all-motivational radio station in 1990.</p><p>4. I attended the Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute for three months, but I left after discovering my teacher, who constantly gave me a hard time, was trying to steal my girlfriend.</p><p>5. I watched the Super Bowl last year with <a href=#><strong>Bruce Springsteen</strong></a> and the E Street Band in a hotel room in Sydney.</p><p>6. I’m a morning person. I love a 6:30 a.m. wake-up.</p><p>7. I have three sons: Jake, 23, [with ex <strong>Jenny Lumet</strong>, 51], and Rocco, 2, and Rafael, 11 months, [with wife<a href=#> <strong>Rose Byrne</strong></a>, 39]. Rocco is currently my favorite.</p><p>8. I love to read books aloud to my children.</p><p>9. I read all seven Harry Potter books aloud to Jake — who used to be my favorite.</p><p>10. I’m a die-hard New York Yankees, Jets and Knicks fan.</p><p>11. I hate to dress up.</p><p>12. I’ve never had a pet.</p><p>13. I don’t want a pet.</p><p>14. I love sitting in my car for an hour and a half on alternate-side street parking days.</p><p>15. I’ve played in a weekly poker game with the same group of guys in Hell’s Kitchen [NYC] for 20 years.</p><p>16. I went to high school with and acted in every play with Brooklyn Nine-Nine’s <strong>Joe Lo Truglio</strong>.</p><p>17. I got singled out by <a href=#><strong>Jay Leno</strong></a> on his show in 1987 when Joe and I heckled him from our front-row seats. Pretty sure it was the first time we smoked pot.</p><p>18. I used to audition as Sergeant Barnes from [1986’s] Platoon: “Y’all know about killing?”</p><p>19. Before fully supporting myself as an actor, I worked as an audition reader. I got three parts that way.</p><p>20. I got to sing and dance with the late, great Jim Gandolfini in what might be my favorite movie I’m in, [2007’s] Romance & Cigarettes.</p><p>21. I worked at a nightclub in the early ’90s with shoe designer <strong>Brian Atwood</strong>.</p><p>22. I’d easily eat pizza every day of my life if I didn’t care (a little) about my weight.</p><p>23. I won my high school talent show singing an original composition called “Please Come Back to Me,” which I wrote for my ex-girlfriend, Marcy Landreth. She didn’t come back to me.</p><p>24. I also won the next year singing OMD’s “If You Leave” with my two-man band Hu-Man Style. (We were awesome.)</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>25. I’m fearless about acting in front of thousands, but terrified about dancing in front of one.</p><p>Amazon’s new series, Homecoming, is available to stream beginning November 2.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJmompKueqStzaeYr5mcmnpzgYytn6Kml6h6urvUZpuopqRiuK%2B71maYm6elqXqusY4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
