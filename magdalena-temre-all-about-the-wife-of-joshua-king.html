Joshua cherishes his marriage and treats his wife like a princess. His inscribed tattoo on his chest proves it. “A guy who loves his girlfriend like a princess is an evidence that he was born and reared in the arms of a queen,” he writes on his tattoo.</p><h2>Mother of two gorgeous children</h2><p>Magdalena has two gorgeous children, a boy, and a daughter. The couple had their first child, Noah, on March 1, 2016, and their daughter Nalia King in 2020.&nbsp;Joshua is of African descent. Joshua Srfather .’s is from The Gambia, a tiny West African nation, and he used to accompany Joshua every year to show him how much he had back home and not to let him take it for granted. Joshua hopes to teach his son Noah the same lesson by bringing him to the Gambia one day. He will be proud of whatever vocation Noah picks or becomes in the future as a parent.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Magdalena-Temre-1.jpg alt="Magdalena Temre" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Her spouse was not given a chance at Everton.</h2><p>Her spouse departed Everton after just spending half of last season there. He was signed by Everton on a season-long agreement with the option of a contract extension, however, his contract was not renewed. Joshua said in an interview that he was not given a chance while at Everton.</p><p>Joshua was constantly thinking about how to prove a point if someone doubted or did not believe him, and he would wake up with the sensation that he needed to be on his A-game. He had a point to make, as he said, by scoring a hat-trick in Watford’s 5-2 triumph against Everton. Joshua previously chastised former Everton manager Carlo Ancelotti for breaking his pledge to the club.</p><p>He said Ancelotti misled him about his playing time at the club. He also confessed that he had no contact with Ancelotti other than as a player. Joshua had no idea he would be barred from starting even one of the 18 games. He went on to make 11 Premier League appearances, all of which were off the bench. He also advised not to believe instructors that make promises such as “you will have a chance, and you will start.”</p><h2>Joshua is a tattoo enthusiast.</h2><p>Joshua is a tattoo enthusiast. He has a black historical piece tattooed over his whole back. Tattoos cover 60 to 70 percent of his body. His tattoos are not religious in nature since, as a free spirit, he wants to get a tattoo of anything he loves and strives to make it stylish.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Magdalena-Temre-2.jpg alt="Magdalena Temre" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Net Worth</h2><p>Joshua’s professional career began in 2008 with Manchester United.
