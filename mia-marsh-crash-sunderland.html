She would light up a room and was one of a kind.</p><p>“We are devastated by what has happened. She was so looking forward to becoming an auntie and we can’t believe that she has been cruelly taken away from us, with her whole future ahead of her."</p><p>Northumbria Police confirmed the collision happened just after 1.20am and they were called to the A1231 between the Northern Spire and Queen Alexandra bridges.</p><p>A black Vauxhall Astra had veered off the carriageway and crossed the central reservation before colliding with the fence, according to police.</p><p>Mia, from the Hylton Castle area of the city, was tragically pronounced dead at the scene.</p><p>A spokesman for Northumbria Police said: "An investigation is ongoing into the circumstances surrounding the collision that led to Mia’s death, which saw three others injured.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The Sun</h2></p><p>"An 18-year-old woman has been arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving and remains under investigation."</p><p>Anyone with any information has been urged to contact Northumbria Police via the ‘Tell Us Something’ page on their website or by calling 101.</p><p>Her family continued: "Mia was a people person. She had just got a job at Footasylum which she loved and was also training at Hays Travel – working to help people and put a smile on their faces.</p><p>“She and her sister McKenzie were best friends, and Mia loved her dog Billy. We have so many treasured memories – holidays together in the caravan growing up, as well as going abroad to Disneyland, Greece and Bulgaria.</p><p>“She loved spending time with her boyfriend Konna, and she really enjoyed shopping, eating out and socialising. She would be constantly singing in every room she was in – you’d always hear her, even if you didn’t see her!</p><p>“As a family, we’ve been blown away by everyone’s response and the messages of support we’ve received – it’s been overwhelming. I’d like to thank everybody for their kindness and it shows how loved Mia was by everyone who knew her.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZ35xgphvbnJnnZ6ubrnAq6qhZZOnrrS0jKysp5yVp7miusNo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
