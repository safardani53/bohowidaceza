She has also decided on a few decor elements.&nbsp;</p><h2>Marriage&nbsp;In Two Continents</h2><p>In conversation with Variety, the pop star <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">confessed</a> she did not know what she wants her wedding to be like. She hasn’t even put much thought into it. All she knows is that there&nbsp;are going to be two weddings.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Since the groom-to-be is from Italy, the couple will have a ceremony there as well. Thorne said the Italian ceremony could be the more fun and crazy one of the two.&nbsp;</p><p>I think the Italy one will probably be more like flying in crazy things, just craziness. Let’s have some [expletive]&nbsp;fun.</p><p>On the other hand, the American wedding will likely be somber and traditional. “Not that anything with me is ever traditional,” she added.&nbsp;</p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><p>The decor will include a lot of flora, that's for sure. The singer, who identifies as a pansexual, plans to have every visible surface and orifice of the venue covered in hanging, dripping flowers and vines.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>He Proposed On Their First Movie Together</h2><p>The Italian hunk popped the big question when the duo was filming for a movie in Spain, and as Thorne put it, “It was very, very cute.” Mascolo also shared the news to his 1.8 million Instagram followers via a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">post</a>. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The post featured the couple sharing an intimate moment together while putting the shimmering&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>pear-shaped diamond cut ring</a>&nbsp;on full display&nbsp;for the netizens to appreciate.</p><p>And appreciate they did. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Within hours, the post was teeming with comments from their friends, fans, and well-wishers. “YES YES YESH IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU GUYS,” wrote The Bachelors star&nbsp;Charlie DePew with thousands more following the lead.&nbsp;</p><h2>Thorne Is An Inspiration</h2><p>Thorne came out as a pansexual via a tweet in a time when accepting these things in public spaces was not “super normal.” Doing what she did, when she did, she became an inspiration to thousands, possibly millions.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s usually the kids that have been soul crushed throughout time, told they couldn’t be themselves, told they couldn’t be this or that, and everything else but themselves.</p><p>She has also gone on record to admit that she released her memoir,&nbsp;The Life of a Wannabe Mogul: Mental Disarray, to reach out to as many&nbsp;people as she could. She derives immense joy from the fact that so many people feel connected to her and feel heard.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGipnqSRqbawutKhoKlnoJ2ur8DOpmSsoZ6csrN5wZ6jpZldqbWwvs2eZKudppqurb%2BMoZyrZZ2Wv7O1wKCcZqiclru0ec%2BlmKerXaS7brTAr6Cnn12pxLB51p6bnaGenMBvtNOmow%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
