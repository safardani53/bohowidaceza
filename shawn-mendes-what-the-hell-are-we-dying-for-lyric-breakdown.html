Started writing this song yesterday morning with my friends in upstate New York & finished it only a few hours ago,” the “Stitches” crooner, 24, wrote via <a href=#>Instagram</a> early on Friday. “Felt important to me to share with you guys in real time&nbsp;<span class=s1>♥️♥️</span>.”</p><p>Mendes teased the release of the track several hours earlier on Thursday, June 8, uploading an Instagram photo of <a href=#>the Manhattan skyline cloaked in smoke</a> amid the Canadian wildfires. (New York City and many East Coast cities have been under an air quality warning since Tuesday, June 6, as a result of the forest fires blowing smoke in its direction. The air, which has made it difficult for residents to breathe, has smelled like a burning campfire and makes the sky look orange.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Is-Shawn-Mendes-Surprise-New-Song-About-Reconciling-With-Ex-Camila-Cabello-5.jpg><p class=p1>The&nbsp;<i>Lyle Lyle Crocodile&nbsp;</i>voice actor, who hails from Canada, also urged his followers on Friday <a href=#>to donate to the Canadian Red Cross</a> and their efforts to provide aid on the frontlines.&nbsp;“What the Hell Are We Dying For?” also features lyrics that directly refer to the wildfires and smoke seen across NYC, as well as potential allusions to rekindling a relationship.</p><p class=p1>“I wanna speak, but I don’t make a sound / Locked in my mind, you’re all I think about,” he sings. “I wanna save us but I don’t know how / If we don’t love like we used to / If we don’t care like we used to / What the hell are we dying for? … If you’re not mine and I’m not yours / What the hell are we dying for?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Is-Shawn-Mendes-Surprise-New-Song-About-Reconciling-With-Ex-Camila-Cabello-2.jpg><p class=p1>Mendes adds in another verse: “Living without you / Is not living at all / So what the hell are we dying for?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Is-Shawn-Mendes-Surprise-New-Song-About-Reconciling-With-Ex-Camila-Cabello.jpg><p class=p1>While the “Mercy” artist has not disclosed all of his musical inspirations, his fans immediately thought <a href=#>he could be referring to Cabello</a>, 26.</p><p class=p1>“He’s so unserious for framing this like a climate change call to action song and it’s literally just about Camila Cabello,” one social media user wrote via <a href=#>Twitter</a> on Friday.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Is-Shawn-Mendes-Surprise-New-Song-About-Reconciling-With-Ex-Camila-Cabello-3.jpg><p class=p1>Another <a href=#>posited</a>: “So you’re gonna use a climate crisis to release a breakup song about Camila Cabello… ikyfl.”</p><p class=p1>Mendes and the&nbsp;<i>Cinderella&nbsp;</i>actress dated for two years before <a href=#>calling it quits in November 2021</a>, ultimately reconnecting earlier this year.
