In the clip, Beyoncé, 35, sings her take on the late Prince’s “Darling Nikki,” crooning, “I met this girl named Nicki / I guess you could say she was the rap queen.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><b>Trey Songz</b> caught wind of the battle and shared his thoughts on Twitter. “Even when you stay out of the way they will have ya name all in some s–t. Wake up to new comedy everyday. Focus,” he wrote. Minaj responded, “LOL. Wut u SHOULD b saying is that it’s not true, seeing as it’s not. Real n—az do real things. I done gotchu 6 million plaques.” Songz, 32, replied, “I didn’t post anything indirect. I gathered a understanding of events and then spoke my piece. You just mad. I still love you.”</p><span class=caption></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGarnZ2ueq6tjJ2pqKijYruqr8qiZKahnpa3brDIrKpmrKKWsKx50p6cZqWZo66rv4yrnKyon6PApnnWbW1xcWFnfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
