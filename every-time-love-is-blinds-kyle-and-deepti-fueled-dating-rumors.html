And I wish I saw what was right in front of me and that’s my biggest regret. I’m sorry.”</p><p>Though his declaration of love surprised viewers, Deepti wasn’t particularly shocked by the depth of his feelings. “A lot of people don’t know that Kyle and I had a really deep connection in the pods,” Deepti told <a href=#>New York Magazine</a> in March 2022. “He was my No. 2 person, so it wasn’t out of the blue. We do have this foundational bond. It was heartwarming and so sweet to hear.”</p><p>As for their relationship, she continued: “The <a href=#>speculation is hilarious</a>. We’re playing with [fans] a little bit, but it’s funny. Kyle and I have such a beautiful friendship.”</p><p>Kyle, for his part, <a href=#>fueled the romance rumors</a> around the same time, posting multiple TikTok videos of him spending time with the information data analyst. In early March, he shared a clip from an event, <a href=#>panning over to reveal Deepti</a> standing behind him before he smiled at the camera. The day after, <a href=#>Kyle posted a video</a> from a Chicago Fire soccer game featuring a hand that appeared to belong to his fellow contestant.</p><p>In the pods, Deepti accepted a proposal from <a href=#><strong>Abhishek “Shake” Chatterjee</strong></a> before calling it quits on their wedding day on the finale. The veterinarian earned a great deal of backlash for repeatedly admitting during the experiment that he didn’t find his then-partner physically attractive — including from Kyle, who accused him of <a href=#>“wast[ing] such a good opportunity”</a> with her.</p><p>“There’s a lot of things that he said that <a href=#>he didn’t say to my face</a> and [things] I’ve heard from other cast members,” Deepti told Us Weekly exclusively in February ahead of the finale. “I just don’t have room for anybody in my life that doesn’t see me in the best way. And who could even think those types of thoughts, I guess. I knew what I had to do [<a href=#>on our wedding day</a>]. No one should have doubts about me, and I deserve the best. So, it’s, like, if you’re not gonna be able to offer it for me, then there’s no chance I’m staying.”</p><p>Fans finally <a href=#>got answers during the After the Altar special,</a> which started streaming in September 2022, when it was revealed that the pair were giving their relationship a shot.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I want him to be my boyfriend. Eventually, I feel like I want him to be my husband,” Deepti said during the third episode. “He’s the first thing I think about when I wake up, he’s the last person I talked to before I go to bed. I look at him and I’m like, ‘I could see myself doing this for the rest of my life.’”</p><p>Scroll through for everything Kyle and Deepti teased about their relationship after the season 2 finale:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNksrex0bJkraGdmnqtu9WeZKKrXZe5qrrDrGSksZyaeqK6w2abnp2gqbZustSeo56cXZmutbXNoGSrrZ2kv7R7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
