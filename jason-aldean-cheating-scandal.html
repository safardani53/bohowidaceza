Jason was married before his marriage to Brittany, and that marriage ultimately dissolved because of a cheating scandal. Jason married Jessica Ussery in 2001 and the two of them were together until 2013 when Ussery filed for divorce citing irreconcilable differences.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Jason Aldean cheated on Jessica Ussery with Brittany Kerr.</h2><p>Perhaps the event that most directly led to the end of Jason's first marriage were pictures that became public of Jason kissing Brittany in a bar. Those pictures were published in 2012, and Jason acknowledged them almost immediately. Brittany also addressed the photos at the time, saying that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she had suffered</a> from a "lapse of judgment" and "would like to sincerely apologize to everyone that has been affected by this."&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Thank y‚Äôall SO much for the sweet birthday messages yesterday!

Seven months after the photos were published, Jessica filed for divorce. In the divorce's aftermath, another relationship began to blossom between Brittany and Jason. The two announced their engagement in 2014 and now have two children together as well. While they're happily married now, they're willing to acknowledge that their relationship had a bumpy start.&nbsp;</p><p>The country singer also said that there were mitigating circumstances in his first marriage. "You know, obviously there was things going on in my marriage at the time where it just wasn't really happy," he explained in a 2013 interview. "And you go out and you kind of let your guard down a little bit and things happen."&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Jason said he's happy the cheating had a positive outcome.</h2><p>During an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">interview</a> on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Velvet's Edge</a> podcast with Kelly Henderson, Jason said that while he had some regrets, his current marriage made all of it worth it. "I think we both probably hated the way it started. But at the end of the day, I wouldn't change the outcome of it at all," Jason said during the interview.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>DATE NIGHT‚ô•Ô∏è</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Brittany Aldean</a> (@brittanyaldean) on Jun 26, 2020 at 4:21pm PDT</p><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brittany</a> echoed her husband's comments, saying that she would have made some changes if she could do everything over. &nbsp;"Obviously, both of us feel this way ‚Äî we would have done things completely differently," Brittany explained.

"It makes me feel sad for people who are maybe in a situation where they don't feel that way, or maybe they haven't met that person yet. I just want this love for everybody."</p><p>In 2015, Brittany expressed similar comments, saying that she was amazed at the outcome of the illicit kiss. "We've been through so much, and we always wanted this to be the outcome," she said. "That we get to spend the rest of our lives together is really, really breathtaking."&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn660u81mmKWclZa7bq%2FHnpitoZ6cerSvwKebmqQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
