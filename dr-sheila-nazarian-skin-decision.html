The eight-episode-long Netflix series captures how <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Sheila Nazarian</a> and her assistant, Jamie Sherrill (aka Nurse Jamie), help patients improve appearances marred by abusive relationships, traumas, and other difficulties.&nbsp;</p><p>As a renowned specialist, Sheila was cast on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Skin Decision</a> to help diversify the public perception of the medical field. So, what's there to know about the plastic surgeon?&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Dr. Sheila Nazarian starred on 'RHOBH' before joining the cast of 'Skin Decision.'</h2><p>Sheila is a leading expert in her chosen field, having perfected techniques ranging from fat freezing and liposuction to CoolSculpting and beyond.&nbsp;</p><p>The Beverly-Hills-based plastic surgeon has an enviable clientele, having worked with stars like Kyle Richards in the past. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Decider</a>, Sheila is no stranger to the world of television, as she has appeared on shows like The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills and The Real.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In addition to her TV appearances, Sheila has built a social media empire to promote her numerous beauty- and wellness-related ventures. She is in charge of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Model Surgeon</a>, an Instagram page promoting her rare achievements as a plastic surgeon, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Skin Spot</a>, an account aiming to disseminate crucial pieces of information on the best and most reliable beauty products out there.&nbsp;</p><p>Sheila also serves as the founder of The Nazarian Institute, an organization helping ambitious entrepreneurs turn their business into a real success.

Although it's uncertain how she met her husband, Dr. Fardad Mobin, it's perhaps reasonable to hypothesize that they were brought together by the love for their chosen profession.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Meet Dr. Fardad Mobin, Sheila Nazarian's husband.</h2><p>Unlike Sheila, Fardad works as a neurosurgeon specializing in spinal and cranial procedures.&nbsp;According to his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn</a> profile, Fardad attended the University of California, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, UC Davis School of Medicine, and UCLA Medical Center before becoming a clinical instructor of neurosurgery at UCLA.&nbsp;</p><p>Fardad was appointed as the co-director of the Spine Institute at the Los Angeles-based St. Vincent Medical Center in August 2011, a position he retains to this day.&nbsp;</p><p>Although Sheila and Fardad tend to be quite secretive about their private life, they do occasionally post photos of their two daughters and son on Instagram. As Sheila explained in a previous interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jewish Journal,</a> she makes sure to take her kids to school every morning â€” even if that comes at the price of having to start work a few hours later than most in her field.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, what's Sheila Nazarian's net worth?</h2><p>Unfortunately, there's not much information available on Sheila's net worth.&nbsp;According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Salary.com</a>, an average Beverly Hills-based plastic surgeon earns between $375,704 and $527,277 depending on skills, experience, and the size of their network.&nbsp;</p><p>Judging by Sheila's robust portfolio of media appearances and her connections with stars like Kris Jenner, it's likely that her annual income is even higher than the rough estimates.&nbsp;</p><p>Skin Decision: Before and After is available on Netflix now.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmb9uv8eeoKWZXaOuu63RopinZaOgtq95w56aoquZpLs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
