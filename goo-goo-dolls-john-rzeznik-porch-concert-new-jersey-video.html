The <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Goo Goo Dolls</strong></a>‘ frontman delivered a 15-minute “porch performance” from the front steps of his own home in Westfield, NJ to help those who’ve lost business amid the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>coronavirus outbreak</a>. The virtual concert, which was streamed on Facebook Live, kicked off the “We Love Local” fundraiser that is raising money for Westfield’s independently owned businesses!</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Westfield Mayor <strong>Shelley Brindle</strong> gave John a warm welcome, before the rock star delivered his own words of encouragement to viewers behind the screen. “Hope everybody is doing the right, staying a few feet away from everybody, staying at home,” John said on his front steps. He proceeded to launch into an acoustic version of the Goo Goo Dolls’ 2019 song “Fearless,” but after singing the lyric “Now’s not the time to hide,” he wanted fans to do exactly the opposite!</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>“Now is the time to hide by the way, with all your friends. Stay on the phone,” John urged viewers. It’s also the time to donate! The fundraiser is looking at a $15,000 goal, which Westfield United Fund has vowed to match (the grassroots organization also helped Westfield residents impacted by 9/11 and Hurricane Sandy). However, the concert reached way beyond the community of Westfield — fans from all over jumped into the Facebook comments section to leave rave reviews of John’s porch performance and his act of charity.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>New Jersey Governor <strong>Philip D.
