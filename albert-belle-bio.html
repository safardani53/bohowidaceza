Their father, Albert Sr., was a high school coach in the sports, as mentioned earlier.</p><p>Subsequently, Albert Jr. steadily rose through the ranks as one of the elite prospects in high school.</p><p>Notably, Belle made the All-State baseball team twice during his time with Huntington High School.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/belle-910.jpg><p>Thereafter, because Albert was one of the best players coming out of high school, he was offered a full scholarship by Louisiana State University.</p><p>Thus, without any hesitation, Belle joined the university as he was born in the state of Louisiana.</p><p>Subsequently, the Louisiana native stayed with the LSU Tigers from 1985 to 1987, during which he made the First Team All-SEC in 1986 and 1987.</p><p>Consequently, by the time Albert finished college, most of the MLB teams wanted the Louisianna-born slugger’s service.</p><h2>Albert Belle | Career & Trades</h2><p>Albert began his professional career in 1989 with the team that drafted him back in 1987, Cleveland Indians.</p><p>After that, Belle stayed with the franchise for another eight years, during which he turned himself into a four-time All-Star from a rookie prospect.</p><p>Most notably, the Louisianna native won led the league three times in RBIs, twice in slugging, and three times in extra bases.</p><p>Added to that, Belle would have won the 1995 MVP award had it not been for his bad reputation in the media and general public.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/belle-911.jpg><p>Following his glorious eight years with the Indians, Albert signed with the Chicago White Sox as a free agent in the winter of 1996.</p><p>The Louisiana native signed a five-year <strong>$55 million deal</strong>, which made him the highest-paid player at the time. Additionally, Belle became the first player in baseball’s history to make <strong>$10 million</strong> in a year.</p><p>Thereafter, Albert enjoyed two successful years with the White Sox, which included a career-high 27-game hitting streak in 1997.</p><p>Added to that, the Louisianna native drove in 152 runs to break the single-season franchise record. Furthermore, Belle made his fifth appearance in the All-Star with the franchise.</p><h4><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chuck Knoblauch Bio: Career, Salary, Net Worth, Family, Age, Height Wiki >></a></strong></h4><p>However, his time with the Chicago-based franchise came to a sad end due to an unusual clause that demanded him to be one of the three highest-paid players in the MLB.</p><p>Consequently, White Sox declined to increase his wage, which in turn resulted in Albert becoming a free agent.</p><p>Thus, everyone in league with the money available arranged meetings with the five-time All-Star in the hopes of securing his services.</p><p>In the end, it was Baltimore Orioles who provided Albert with a contract he simply could not refuse.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/belle-913.jpg><p>To explain, the Orioles offered him a five-year <strong>$65 million deal ($99.7 million</strong> in today’s market). Consequently, for the second time in his career, Belle became the highest-paid player in MLB.</p><p>After that, the Orioles left fielder enjoyed two relatively acceptable seasons before being forced into retirement by a degenerative hip injury.</p><p>Not to mention, he was just 34 years old on the day of his retirement.&nbsp;Nevertheless, due to a clause in his contract, Albert remained on the 40 man roster for his five-year contract duration.</p><p>In conclusion, the five-time All-Star retired as one of the best baseballers to ever grace the ballpark.</p><p>Added to that, Belle was also one of the highest earners of his era, which made his career even sweeter.</p><p>You might also want to read: <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">&lt;&lt;Devon Toews Bio: Salary, Siblings, Career, CapFriendly, Contract Wiki >></a></strong></p><h2>How old is Albert Belle? Age, Height & Body Measurements</h2><p>Having been born in the year, 1966 makes Belle’s age 57&nbsp;years&nbsp;currently. Albert started playing professionally from the age of 23, which is not that young.</p><p>Nevertheless, he played in the MLB for another 11 years till the age of 34.</p><p>Furthermore, the five-time All-Star stands at 6 feet 1 inch, which is just below the average height for an MLB player.</p><p>Nonetheless, due to his relatively short height, Albert could swing his arm faster than most other players.</p><p>For instance, Belle became the only player in history to hit 50 doubles and 50 home runs in a season during 1995.</p><p>Don’t forget to check out: <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">&lt;&lt;Eben Britton Bio: Net Worth, Hotboxin, Wife, Height, Salary Wiki >></a></strong></p><h2>Albert Belle | Controversies</h2><p>In 1990, Albert Belle was spent ten weeks in the Cleveland Clinics while rehabilitating for the treatment of alcoholism. Back then, he was playing for the Cleveland Indians.&nbsp;</p><p>Apparently, Belle has been in many controversies to date and thus, has an array of history for his notorious works.&nbsp;</p><h3>Corked Bat and Fight</h3><p>During his tenure with the Cleveland Indians, Belle was sent to a seven days suspension after being caught with the corked bats.</p><p>To elaborate, he had used a corked bat while involving his teammate Jason Grimsley.&nbsp;</p><p>Back then, they reported that Belle asked Jason to break into the umpire’s locker room and replace the bat with the corked bat.</p><p>Although they took it lightly in the initial phase, they got serious later after the inclusion of the event in Omar Vizquel’s autobiography.&nbsp;</p><p>Apart from it, he was also fined after knocking Brewers&nbsp;infielder&nbsp;Fernando Viña during the games.&nbsp;</p><h3>Reporters about Belle</h3><p>As a matter of fact, Belle hasn’t had a good impression among the reporters.</p><p>Apparently, Albert Belle wouldn’t appear for any interviews before his games, and when asked, he would say it wasn’t necessary.&nbsp;</p><p>“Guys such as Sandy Koufax,<a href=#>&nbsp;Joe DiMaggio</a>, and Steve Carlton did not interview, and it was no big deal. They were quiet. I am also quiet. I just want to concentrate on baseball. Why does everyone want to hear me talk, anyway?”</p><p>However, the media commenced posting controversies about him. Even when he had his career-ending injury, the media didn’t show any sympathy towards him.&nbsp;</p><p>“Sorry, there’ll be no words of sympathy here for Albert Belle. He was a surly jerk before he got hurt, and now he’s a hurt surly jerk…He was no credit to the game.”<br>-New York Daily News&nbsp;columnist&nbsp;Bill Madden</p><p>“It was a taken in baseball circles that Albert Belle was nuts… The Indians billed him $10,000 a year for the damage he caused in clubhouses on the road and at home and tolerated his behavior only because he was an awesome slugger.”&nbsp;</p><p><h2>Albert Belle | Career stats and Highlights</h2></p><table class="vk_tbl Uekwlc"><tbody><tr><th class="Z3XQ4e Gt0LNd"></th><th class="Z3XQ4e Gt0LNd"></th><th class="Z3XQ4e
