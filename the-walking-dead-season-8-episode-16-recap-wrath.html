Negan and his team set off and even took Father Gabriel along for the ride.&nbsp;</p><p>Negan admitted to Gabriel on the road that he was messing with Rick by putting some of his men in a place that Rick and the AHK alliance would find them.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>This would give Negan more time to laugh because it meant Rick would think the information Dwight gave them was the real deal.&nbsp;</p><p>In true Rick fashion, he figured that it was all a ruse, and told his people it was time to change things up.&nbsp;</p><p>Gabriel made a run for it, but Eugene appeared in the woods and held him captive until Negan showed up. While Negan wondered whether to kill Gabriel, he decided to keep him as a bargaining chip.&nbsp;</p><p>Just when Negan thought he had the upper hand and his men were ready to fight the AHK alliance, their bullets blew up in their guns.&nbsp;</p><p>Oh yes, Eugene was still working with his original alliance, and it was a plan months in the making. Negan tried to make a break for freedom.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>At the Hilltop, another round of Saviors tried to take over, but the Oceanside women&nbsp;were talked around to helping the AHK alliance.&nbsp;</p><p>They chucked bombs at the Saviors and allowed Hilltop to remain under the spell of the good guys.&nbsp;</p><p>Rick and Negan&nbsp;fought it out, and Rick eventually cut&nbsp;Negan’s throat. But that did not mean he was going to die, and Rick ordered Siddiq to save the villain’s life.&nbsp;</p><p>Rick said that he was ready to put the past behind him and that everyone will stop the fighting. Maggie and Daryl were less than enthused by this, and seem poised to go after Rick.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, Negan woke up and Rick and Michonne admitted they were keeping him alive so that everyone knew they were building a civilization.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>It looks like Carl’s letter had a lasting effect on Rick, and that’s why the father wrote a letter of his own back to his son.&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, it seems like The Walking Dead Season 9 is going to be very different.&nbsp;</p><p>What did you think of the episode?</p><p>Sound off below.&nbsp;</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>The Walking Dead Cast: Before They Were Stars…</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pwX2WBcMDHnmSwmZygtq%2BzjJ2cmpxdqLKiv86nZHFllaW2tLvDnmRqbl2nsqStz2auq5mknXw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
