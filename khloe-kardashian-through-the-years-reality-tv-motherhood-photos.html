Since then, the women have taken nearly every industry imaginable by storm.</p><p>Khloé, for her part, hosted her own shows, launched a thriving clothing line and grew her family. The reality star welcomed her first child, daughter <a href=#>True</a>, with then-boyfriend <a href=#><strong>Tristan Thompson</strong></a> in April 2018.</p><p>Years before she began her journey with motherhood, fans watched Khloé marry <a href=#><strong>Lamar Odom</strong></a> in September 2009 after a whirlwind romance.
