Over the span of three days, 12 teams left it all out on the field to see which six teams would advance to the Divisional Round — and join the No. 1 seeds in the AFC and NFC — <a href=#>to make the final eight count</a>.</p><p>The <a href=#>Kansas City Chiefs</a>, who were the No. 1 seed in the AFC, remained triumphant over the Jacksonville Jaguars during their January 21 game. The NFC’s No. 1 seed The Philadelphia Eagles also remained victorious the same day in their matchup against the New York Giants.</p><p>Viewers had to <a href=#>watch two more games</a> — between the Chiefs and the Cincinnati Bengals and the Eagles against the San Francisco 49ers — on Sunday, January 29, to learn who would be facing off in Super Bowl LVII.</p><p>When it came to the AFC Championship both the Chiefs’ <a href=#><strong>Patrick Mahomes</strong></a> and Bengals’ <a href=#><strong>Joe Burrow</strong></a> have played in a Super Bowl — and <a href=#>Mahomes has won one Vince Lombardi trophy</a>. On the NFC side, Eagles quarterback <strong>Jalen Hurts</strong> and <a href=#>49ers backup quarterback <strong>Brock Purdy</strong></a> are new to the Super Bowl conversation.</p><p>Ultimately, Mahomes’ squad triumphed over the Bengals and will face the Eagles for Super Bowl LVII.</p><p>In addition to watching the big game, FOX announced in January <a href=#>which performers would be entertaining</a> the crowd in Arizona on February 12.</p><p>Though rumors swirled that <a href=#><strong>Taylor Swift</strong></a> would be taking the stage at the 2023 Super Bowl Halftime Show, <a href=#><strong>Rihanna</strong></a> was <a href=#>confirmed as the performer in September 2022</a>. The decision left Rihanna fans desperate for a new album and psyched for her performance and potential new music.</p><p>The “Umbrella” songstress has been toying with her loyal followers since December 2018 when she teased that her next album was coming in 2019. The record, <a href=#>R9, has yet to drop</a>, but Rihanna’s Super Bowl performance has many thinking the album is near.</p><p>“If @Rihanna starts the Superbowl [sic] with fresh songs off #R9, my soul will exit this dimension, I’ll be in a trance I swear,” one fan tweeted in fall 2022. Another superfan wrote via Twitter, “RIHANNA IS DOING THE SUPER BOWL HALFTIME SHOW #R9 COMING SUPER SOON.”</p><p>The <a href=#>“Love the Way You Lie” singer</a>, for her part, poked fun at how long it’s been since her last record via <a href=#>a January 13 teaser for her halftime gig</a>.</p><p>In the video, Rihanna — who released the Black Panther single in “Lift Me Up” in October 2022 — walks toward the camera in a bright fur coat as voices in the background say, “It’s been two thousand hundred ninety days,” <a href=#>referring to the six-year wait for new songs</a>. Another soundbite adds, “Rihanna, we’ve waited for you,” while a third voice explains, “Rihanna is who everybody is waiting for.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Grammy winner cheekily puts her finger to her lips in a “shhhh” gesture to the camera as her 2016 song “Needed Me” plays in the background. “You need me,” she sings on the track.</p><p>Scroll down to learn more about Super Bowl LVII:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BowrGx0WaZqK%2BcYrm3tchmrqGZpGLBsHnKp6awZZGXvLbAjK2fnmViZX90ecWopq2akaG5brPAppxo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
