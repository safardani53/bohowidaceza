She went on to score leading roles in films like The Greatest Showman, Spider-Man: Homecoming and Malcolm & Marie.</p><p class=p2>One of her most recent roles is Rue Bennett in the HBO drama, <a href=#>Euphoria</a>. Her acting earned her a Primetime Emmy, People’s Choice Awards and more — and the on screen beauty of it all is simply too much to handle.</p><p class=p2><span class=s2>With such a stacked acting resume, the star finds herself on dozens of red carpets — and she never disappoints. So while it’s borderline impossible to choose just one of the star’s best fashion looks over the years, Us Weekly’s Stylish has rounded up a handful.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class=p2><span class=s2>A throwback we’ll obsess over until the end of time is her ball gown from the <a href=#>2017 Met Gala</a>. The California native dressed to impress for the annual event in an off-the-shoulder Dolce & Gabbana gown covered in a whimsical, colorful parrot pattern.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class=p2><span class=s2>Her glam was just as mesmerizing as her gown. The star rocked a voluminous afro and orange-toned makeup to match her dress.</span></p><p class=p2><span class=s2>One of our all-time favorites came to pass at the 71st annual Emmy Awards, where she wore a strapless emerald green stunner by Vera Wang which she paired with matching Brian Atwood pumps.</span></p><p class=p2><span class=s2>While IRL red carpets took a backseat in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the fashion icon brought out her best looks to date in 2021. And with a little help from stylist <strong>Law Roach</strong>, nearly every look carried a touching tribute.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class=p2><span class=s2>At the BET Awards for example, Zendaya paid tribute to <a href=#><strong>Beyoncé</strong></a>, wearing a reimagined version of the same vintage Versace gown the Ivy Park founder wore to the awards in 2003. Rather than wearing a mini version like Queen B did during her on-stage performance, The Greatest Showman star rocked a midi-length version.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p2>Flash-forward to the <a href=#>Time 100 Gala</a> in June 2022, Zendaya was a vision in a stunning Bob Mackie dress, which was first seen on the runway in 1998. The gown featured a geometric construction, consisting of sections in shades of turquoise and black. The bodice of the number was designed with a sweetheart neckline and was finalized with billowing skirt.</p><p class=p2><span class=s2>To see all these looks and more of Zendaya’s all-time best red carpet moments, keep scrolling!<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6poJyspaeytHvZnqWdmamWwG6ty6VkraGdmnqjsdKtZJ%2BZo522sLqMpqamnZ6pwG7Ax6umrp%2BYYsGpsYyynJqqo2K9qq%2FSaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
