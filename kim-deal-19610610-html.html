She was bassist and co-vocalist in the alternative rock band Pixies, before forming the Breeders in 1989. Deal joined Pixies in January 1986, adopting the stage name Mrs. John Murphy for the albums Come on Pilgrim and Surfer Rosa. Following Doolittle and the Pixies' hiatus, she formed the Breeders with Tanya Donelly, Josephine Wiggs, and Britt Walford. Following the band's debut album Pod, her twin sister Kelley Deal joined, replacing Tanya Donelly. Pixies broke up in early 1993, and Deal returned her focus to the Breeders, who released the platinum-selling album Last Splash in 1993, with the single "Cannonball". In 1994, the Breeders went into hiatus after Deal's sister Kelley entered drug rehabilitation. During the band's hiatus, Deal adopted the stage name Tammy Ampersand and formed the short-lived rock band the Amps, recording a single album, Pacer, in 1995.</p><table class=wikibox readability=13><tr><td class=wk_label>Birth name</td><td class=wk_value>Kimberley Ann Deal</td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=wk_label>Also known as</td><td class=wk_value>Mrs. John Murphy, Tammy Ampersand</td></tr><tr readability=6><td class=wk_label>Born</td><td class=wk_value>June 10, 1961, Dayton, Ohio, U.S.</td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=wk_label>Genres</td><td class=wk_value>Alternative rock, noise pop</td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=wk_label>Occupation(s)</td><td class=wk_value>Musician, singer-songwriter</td></tr><tr readability=6><td class=wk_label>Instruments</td><td class=wk_value>Vocals, guitar, bass, keyboards, drums</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Years active</td><td class=wk_value>1986–present</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Labels</td><td class=wk_value>4AD, Elektra Records</td></tr><tr readability=5><td class=wk_label>Associated acts</td><td class=wk_value>The Breeders, Pixies, The Amps, Courtney Barnett</td></tr></table><p>Bassist Kim Deal was born on June 10, 1961 in Dayton, Ohio, United States (She's 62 years old now).</p><p>Vocalist and bassist who rose to fame with the alternative rock band The Pixies and later joined The Breeders as a vocalist and guitarist.</p><p>All info about Kim Deal can be found here.
