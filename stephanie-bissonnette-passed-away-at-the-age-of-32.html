She discovered she had cancer a few days later and needed six weeks of treatment at a New York facility. The therapy was set for five days each week, and she had to take a nine-month vacation from performing.&nbsp;According to SurvivorNet, she believed she would never be able to dance again and that the period between her surgery and radiotherapy was the most difficult for her. She stated:</p><p>“It almost felt worse because I just wanted to start so I could be done. So I simply stayed in my room, unhappy, for a month. It wasn’t a happy moment. I was clearly sobbing a lot. I was nervous. My career seemed to be coming to an end. I began to wonder, “What would I do if I couldn’t do this for a job anymore?”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Stephanie-Bissonnette-2.jpg alt="Stephanie Bissonnette" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Following her recuperation, she and the other Mean Girls cast members celebrated a year since her operation in 2020.&nbsp;Stephanie Bissonnette’s survivors include family members whose names have not been revealed.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiqrZ2gna6vtcRmmaKro6S7r7HTrZxmqJGowKawjJqumrFdlsFuwMeeZJqflWK8p3mSa2Y%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
