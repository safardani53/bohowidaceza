This is my life. This is what’s going on. Or this is what’s not going on.’”</p><p>The Lost Daughter actor and the Grammy nominee <a href=#>first connected via social media</a> in May 2020.</p><p>“Finished Normal People and now I’m sad and horny oh wait,” the “Kyoto” songstress tweeted at the time after watching Mescal’s Hulu series. The Aftersun actor replied to the tweet, writing, “I’m officially dead.” Bridgers then shot back: “Nooo don’t die your [sic] so talented aha.”</p><p>The <a href=#>pair fueled romance rumors</a> that July when they were spotted getting cozy in an Irish cafe. The following November, they made their red carpet debut as a couple at the LACMA Art+Film Gala.</p><p>Bridgers’ 2022 song “Sidelines” — which appeared in the television series <a href=#>Conversation With Friends</a> — was inspired by her romance with Mescal.</p><p>“Writing about my relationship with only good s—t, because that’s all I feel, is hard,” she told <a href=# rel=noopener>The Guardian</a> in July 2022. “But it makes it easy when you’re actually having those feelings.”</p><p>Despite the California native’s comments, <a href=#>rumors that the pair had split</a> began to swirl in December 2022 after Bridgers was spotted with <a href=#><strong>Bo Burnham</strong></a> on several occasions. Neither the Boygenius musician nor the God’s Creatures actor have publicly addressed the alleged breakup.</p><p>“Giving strangers an answer … <a href=#>doesn’t actually help</a>,” Mescal told Vanity Fair. “It’s [just], like, a quick boost of serotonin, being like, ‘I’ve said what I need to say.’”</p><p>Bridgers, for her part, <a href=#>shared advice for moving on from heartbreak</a> during a December 2022 appearance on the “Chick Shop Date” YouTube series.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“You just have to do it,” the singer-songwriter said. “And<a href=#> it’s gonna end at some point</a>, but you can’t make it end.”</p><p>When asked what she’s learned from heartbreak, Bridgers replied, “I think if I had figured that out, I wouldn’t be making music still.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGapmaWheq6x0pyYpWWRmbGzsdKsnKxloJ28pq7EZpmroZScsrO%2FjKynpaGkYsCxscKuo5qsmaS7cA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
