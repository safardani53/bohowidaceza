Now her likely replacement is dissing the mother of one for having sex with people she doesn’t know for money and fame. In an EXCLUSIVE interview with <strong>HollywoodLife.com</strong>,&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Mackenzie McKee</strong></a>, 23, tells us,&nbsp;“I truly hope&nbsp;<span class=il>Farrah</span>&nbsp;didn’t inspire anyone to have&nbsp;<span class=il>sex</span>&nbsp;with&nbsp;<span class=il>strangers</span>&nbsp;on camera and disrespect their body in such a way because she was a role model and young girls look up to these girls.” Ouch!</p><p id=content-paragraph-2>She adds, “But I don’t know&nbsp;<span class=il>Farrah</span>&nbsp;on a personal level, I don’t know the things she has been through and why she went the route she did.” Farrah caused a massive storm of controversy when she starred in Farrah Superstar: Backdoor Teen Mom in 2013 alongside porn legend <strong>James Deen</strong>, 32. She initially tried to claim it was a leaked sex tape until James told the world it was all business. Farrah didn’t put her adult video past behind her though. In Oct. of 2017 the show’s executive producer <strong>Morgan Freeman</strong> showed up at her house with a camera crew and told her to choose between&nbsp;Teen Mom OG or her scheduled live stream Halloween one woman anal sex show. She refused to back down from the live online porn act and got canned.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Mackenzie starred on Teen Mom 3 and is reportedly replacing Farrah on OG. The married mother of two is a fitness fanatic and growing her inspirational workout business <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Body by Mac</a>. While do doubt she will likely make viewers want to hit the gym, we don’t know yet if she’s got the theatrics to replace someone as mercurial as Farrah.&nbsp;While Farrah might have been a giant pain in the ass for producers and co-stars, she did bring drama that helped the show thrive and she knows it.&nbsp;“I’m out on a high note. This is the longest season in history and I’m their biggest star,”she confidently told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Us Weekly</a>. She added&nbsp;“You could take all the girls on all the series, but none can bring or do as much as I do for the series.” Sadly, its hard to argue with her point.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>You can watch tonight, March 12, as Farrah gets fired when Teen Mom OG airs on MTV at 9pm EST.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWloZH10e5BrZq2dlaN6rrvMZqSam5uau7u1xGaknKOVmnqltdKsnKxllpa%2Fs63HZpibqpGdrq55z6ipp2WjmsVuv9OrmKeflafAcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
