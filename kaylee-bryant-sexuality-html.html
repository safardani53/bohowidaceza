She identified her sexuality as pansexual, meaning she was attracted to people regardless of their gender identity. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>It was a huge milestone for the franchise and the LGBTQ+ community who watched it. Since Bryant portrayed the character, many questioned her sexuality as well.</p><p></p><p><strong>Kaylee Bryant posing for a picture. </strong>(Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)<span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Fans wondered if she belonged to the LGBTQ+ community and what her gender identity was.</p><h2>&nbsp;What Is Kaylee Bryant's Sexuality?</h2><p>The actress was silent about her sexuality and gender orientation for a long time. But she eventually came out in June 2020 at the beginning of Pride Month.</p><p>Pride Month is an annual month-long celebration dedicated to the LGBTQ+ community, celebrating their history and rights. Many people choose the occasion to come out during this time of the year annually.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Bryant was one such person who revealed her sexuality and gender orientation via Instagram. She posted a picture of herself wearing a t-shirt that read, "Be the bold queer you needed to see in your youth."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>She held a rainbow flag and stuck out her tongue to the camera. In the captions, she wrote, "Hi, my name is Kaylee, and I'm queer! Happy Pride Month!"</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>Kaylee Bryant coming out post where she revealed her sexuality.</strong> (Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Bryant was met with admiration and support for coming out on her post. Many took to Twitter as well to congratulate the Legacies star and lauded her for her strength to come out to the public.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>Kaylee Bryant on Playing Josie&nbsp;Saltzman</h2><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="follow noopener">Grumpy Magazine</a>&nbsp;for their November 2019 cover story, Bryant talked about her role in Legacies. She confessed that Saltzman's sexuality attracted her to portray the character. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She said, "What attracted me specifically to Josie was, number one, her sexual fluidity." It appealed to the actress that Saltzman was a "representation for young men and women."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>She added that there was a lot of work to be done on the character, but "so little of it was said." Nevertheless, she was "ecstatic" to work on it and take upon the challenge.</p><p>The actress understood her character and said how Saltzman was someone "who just didn't know who she was or how to stand up for herself, or when to stand up for herself."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Something was going on in her brain constantly, and Bryant wanted to validate that as an actor. But, all in all, the actress had a blast portraying Saltzman. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Unfortunately, she is no longer a part of Legacies. In late 2021, she and her character would <a href=# rel=follow>leave the show</a>.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Bryant took to Instagram to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">thank her fans</a> for accepting her and her character in the show. She thanked them and appreciated Saltzman for helping "so many beautiful humans feel comfortable in their sexuality."</p><p>At last, she hoped that Saltzman's legacy would live on so that everyone would "feel free to love whoever they want regardless of gender."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKORrrmmsYybqbKZnql6tLHXrpiloaSue6nAzKU%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
