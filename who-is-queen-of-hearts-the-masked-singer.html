In one elaborate YouTube comment, a fan explains that the first clue is a bit obvious with the literal jewel. They also pointed out that the Wizard of Oz characters could be a nod to Jewel playing Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz in Concert in 1995. Jewel also has an album called "Goodbye Alice in Wonderland" and albums "Picking up the Pieces" and "Pieces of You," which connect back to the given clues (BTW, "Pieces of You" won a Blockbuster Entertainment Award back in 1998!).</p><p>Others think that the Southern drawl and references to The Wizard of Oz clearly mean it's <a href=#>Kristin Chenoweth</a>, who famously played Glinda in the original Broadway cast of Wicked.
