At first you don’t know how to handle it.”</p><span class=caption></span><p>Jenner came out as transgender in April 2015, and made headlines a few months later, in June 2015, when she covered <i>Vanity Fair </i>wearing a strapless white bodysuit.</p><p>“I know my kids, they thought, You know what, it’s a little too much,” she said. “But, from my standpoint, I had suffered for 65 years. To have a beautiful shot of my authentic self was important and [I wanted] the shock value. I wanted to end the old Bruce, my old life, and that picture did it.”</p><p>Jenner shares two daughters, <b><a href=#>Kylie</a></b> and <b><a href=#>Kendall Jenner</a></b>, with ex-wife <b><a href=#>Kris Jenner</a></b>, and helped raise Kris’ four kids from her previous marriage to Robert Kardashian<b> </b>— <b><a href=#>Kourtney</a></b>, <b><a href=#>Kim</a></b>, <b><a href=#>Khloé</a></b> and <b><a href=#>Rob</a></b>. But she admitted in the <i>20/20</i> interview that <a href=#>she’s become “distant”</a> from some members of the Kardashian clan. The LGBT spokeswoman also has four other children (<b>Brody</b>, <b>Brandon</b>, <b>Cassandra</b> and <b>Burt</b>) from her first two marriages.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Overall, however, Jenner said that she feels “happy” with where she’s at. “[There is] peace in my soul,” she told Sawyer. “All that confusion has left me.” Jenner’s memoir, <i>The Secrets of My Life</i>, is out Tuesday, April 25.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacmZmpubq6jKOcp6aVp3qku82foKulo2K0prrDnqlmqpWWwLS1xqeknqakYsC2vsaeqbJln6N6c3yRaWSwbGdtgHGCjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
