Paul Gadd and his father Gary Glitter had a strong relationship before Gary got imprisoned.</p><p>Gary had previously paid numerous visits to his son Paul at his house in Stoke Gabriel, South Devon. Paul no longer wants anything to do with his father. He even warned his father Gary to avoid him. Paul informed his father, “You’re not welcome here.” Paul stated.</p><p>“He’s not coming back here after what he’s done.” I haven’t contacted my father and don’t intend to.” “I have a beautiful home here,” Paul explained, “and I don’t want him to come and spoil it.” Gary Glitter was scheduled to be released after serving eight weeks of a four-month sentence for downloading 4,000 child pornographic photos on the Internet.</p><h2>Gary Jr. Is Meet The Second Son Of Gary Glitter</h2><p><strong>Gary Pantoja Sosa</strong> is Gary Glitter’s younger brother.

Gary said that his only daughter Sarah was fathered by his best friend.</p><p>Gary Glitter claims that his ex-wife Ann Murton had an affair with his best friend before they split. Gary claims that Sarah is not his biological daughter. “I didn’t see Sarah very often,” he explained. I’m embarrassed. She probably didn’t want to see me because I wasn’t her biological father.”</p><p>Gary Glitter just stated that his son “Paul clarified that she was not. At the time, I was living in Germany. Paul, my son, stated that I was not the father. I feel my wife Ann was having an affair with my best buddy, and I still believe he is her father. She is not my biological daughter.”</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGinmq2cYsCivsChZJqmlGK0or7YZqGrZZ2asrV5xpqpsmWXoba1wMSrZJygmaGxs7HNaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
