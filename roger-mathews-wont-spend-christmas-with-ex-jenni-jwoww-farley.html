The kids are happy, Jenni and Zack are happy and I couldn’t be happier.”</p><p>Mathews and the reality star were married for nearly three years — they wed in 2015 — before Farley, 33, filed for divorce in September 2018. The split was messy, with Farley getting a temporary restraining order against her estranged husband after their breakup, but the former couple are now focused on their children and are on the same page.</p><p>Farley spoke about the divorce on the <a href=#>October 31 episode of Jersey Shore: Family Vacation</a>.&nbsp;“We were talking about regrets earlier — I’ve been thinking about the biggest one,” Farley said on the episode, which led <a href=#><strong>Nicole “Snooki” Polizzi</strong></a> to ask if she was referring to Mathews, which Farley confirmed.</p><p>“I’m going through it with the divorce. It’s been almost a year since I filed,” Farley continued. “When you get divorced, you’re supposed to be celebrating and start a new chapter, but it’s really heartbreaking. And it’s stressful, the up and down battle of figuring out custody issues. I just don’t know when it gets better.”</p><p>After seeing what his ex said on the reality series, Matthews <a href=#>opened up to Us in November</a> about their split. “You don’t spend almost a decade of your life with only one person then just never care about them again. You can act like you do but you’re probably lying,” Mathews said in an exclusive statement to Us&nbsp;on November 1. “Hatred spawns from love.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Farley began dating wrestler Carpinello <a href=#>after splitting from Mathews</a>, confirming their relationship in April.
