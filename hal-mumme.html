Furthermore, Harry Clay (father) and Hallie Younger (mother)were the ones to brought Mumme into being. Unfortunately, we cannot find much information about Hal’s parents.</p><p>Similarly, as per many sources, Hal had an average childhood. His parents come from a middle-class family; he neither had a lavish life nor had a poor life.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/B3912AD3-3CA3-4774-A5C1-8B7794FBFDA9-1024x579.jpeg><p>During the early phase, Hal even played football for Thomas Jefferson High School as a receiver. Hence, this clearly shows that Hal had an interest in football from a very early age.</p><p>Nonetheless, as an undergraduate, Hal joins New Mexico Military Institute and Tarleton State University. Even though he was an undergraduate, he was a member of the Kappa Alpha Order fraternity.</p><h2>Hal Mumme Career</h2><h3>Playing Career</h3><p>From a very early age, Mumme had started his career. At first, he began as a football player. Then, correspondingly, Mumme played as a receiver for <strong>Thomas Jefferson High School.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/BxbTRfzIEAAmIxb.jpg><p>Likewise, Mumme also played at New Mexico Military Institute during his university days. Despite this, Hal was also a <strong>Kappa Alpha Order Federation member</strong> while he was still an undergraduate.</p><h3>Coaching Career</h3><p><strong>Hal Mumme started his career as a coach in</strong> <strong>1976</strong>. However, he was just an offensive coordinator at Foy H. Moody High School, and he worked there as an offensive coordinator for two years.</p><p>Yet, it didn’t take Hal a lot of time to be a head coach. Soon after Hal leaves his job as an offensive coordinator, he became the Aransas Pass High School head coach in 1970.</p><p>Again in 1980, Hal worked as an assistant coach under Bill Yung at West Texas State University.&nbsp;</p><p>Identically, as an assistant coach, Mumme developed an orthodox,pass-oriented offensive attack that successfully moved the ball and scoring points. Thus, from the beginning of Hal’s career, he successfully proved himself a good coach.</p><h4>1990/95</h4><p>In 1991, Hal Mumme, in his first season as a <strong>head coach of Iowa Wesleyan College</strong>, led the team to the national quarterfinal after finishing with a 7-4 record.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/45D3FE38-88C4-43DF-965F-F27AED99F917-1024x817.jpeg><p>In parallel, Hal was awarded <strong>NIAA district coach of the year in 1991</strong> after finishing at Iowa Wesleyan with a 25-10 record.</p><p>Even so, after resigning from Iowa, Hal joined Valdosta State University in 1992. Additionally, Hal even led the team to the NCAA Division II playoff quarterfinals.</p><p>Consistently, the team was ranked #1 in the national Division II for half of the 1996 season while winning their first Gulf 50 4th Conference Championship.</p><p>At the same time, Hal proved to be a better coach because Valdosata had never been in the playoffs before Hal started coaching them.</p><h4>Early Career</h4><p>In 1996, the University of Kentucky replaced Bill Curry and appointed Hal as the Head Coach. Before all else, Hal improved the previous records; in his guidance, the team set multiple schools, SEC and, NCAA records.</p><p>In addition, Kentucky got victory one game after another. Previously, it never made even to the qualifiers, but hiring Hal changed everything for them.</p><p>On the other hand, in 2000, Hal’s team performance dropped to 2-9. Moreover, Hal had to deal with many allegations regarding NCAA rules violations. As a result, the whole team lost the final eight games.</p><p>Nevertheless, in 2001 Hal decides to resign after being charged with various allegations. Later, in investigations, the lawsuit found that Hal and his team were guilty.</p><p>After taking a break of 18 months, Hal finally returns to football as a Head coach for Southeastern Louisiana Lions. But, equally important, this was Lion’s first match after 1985 at the NCAA Division I-AA level.</p><p>Undoubtedly, Hal is a brilliant coach; after so many years, the Lions finally entered the Top 25 in the national I-AA rankings.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/636594229150640250-uscpcent02-6zqbi2w5rmtaieyi6ax-original.jpg><p>After leaving Lions, Hal joined New Mexico State in 2004. However, Hal had to face a lot of trouble on the flip side after four Muslim NMSU players accused Mumme of discrimination.</p><p>Therefore, they claimed Hal subjected them to a hostile work environment because of their religion.</p><p>Further, Hal settled the lawsuit out of court after Hal agreed to pay $165,000 to four players.</p><p>On the other hand, after four years of joining, NMSU fires Hal on December 1 of 2008, since Hal’s team couldn’t perform in the last seven matches to the end season.</p><p>Again in 2009, Division III McMurry University hires Hal. Not surprisingly, Hal’s team wins the season, which becomes McMurry’s first season win since 2000.</p><h4>Further,</h4><h4><span>Hal was with McMurry for three years, and McMurry successfully wins several matches under Hal’s guidance.</span></h4><p><strong>However, in 2014 NAIA School Belhaven University appoints Hal as a head coach</strong>. Before Hal joined Belhaven, their record was 3-8. Nonetheless, after hiring Hal, Belhaven made the record of 2-9.</p><p>Similarly, in 2017, Hal Mumme joins Jackson State but soon after joining State, Hal announced his resignation. Hal later clarified he resigned to pursue other professional opportunities.</p><p>After resigning from State, Hal joins Dallas Renegades. But, he didn’t stay with them for an extended period either. Shortly after two weeks of joining Dallas, he resigns from there as well.</p><p></p><p>Despite this, Dallas hired Hal.

After the injury, Mumme remained on the team as an advisor.</p><h2>Hal Mumme: Net Worth</h2><p>Assuredly, Hal Mumme has earned enough money from his coaching career.</p><p>Hal Mumme has a net worth of <strong>$1 million</strong>.

Hal had his lowest moment in 2009 when he was diagnosed with cancer. Fortunately, it was just the first stage, and due to timely treatment, Hal survived cancer.</p><p>However, it was not the end of the problems for him. Again after some time, his wife June was diagnosed with breast cancer. Though, she is also lucky to survive that deadly disease.</p><p>Currently, both June and Hal are active in social work. Since they are cancer survivors, they help other people suffering from cancer.
