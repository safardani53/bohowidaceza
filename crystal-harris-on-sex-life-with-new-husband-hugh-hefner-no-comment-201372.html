During an appearance on <a href=#>HuffPost Live</a> on Wednesday, Feb. 6, the magazine mogul's wife offered "no comment" when asked if they have sex.</p><p>"I feel like since Hef is older now and he's had . . . the phases of all the girlfriends and all that kind of stuff . . . I feel now is more, you know, like cuddling up and watching a movie or playing backgammon," the 26-year-old said. "We play Uno with the girls."</p><p>Harris — whose June 2011 Playboy cover was given a "Runaway Bride" sticker after she called off their first wedding — also cleared up rumors about Hefner's skills in the boudoir. (In a <a href=#>July 2011 interview</a> with <strong>Howard Stern</strong>, the model said Hefner lasted "two seconds" and said she was "not turned on" by the octogenarian.)</p><p>"When I first left, I did some interviews I shouldn't have done. I was mad. It was a breakup, and I shouldn't have done some of the things," Harris explained. "At the time I had a bad publicist, so things did get switched and turned around."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Harris <a href=#>announced they were back together</a> in June 2012 via Twitter. Though they never publicly addressed engagement rumors, the two obtained a marriage license weeks before tying the knot in December.</p><p>Though a source recently told <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> Harris has been <a href=#>left out of 86-year-old Hefner's will</a>, that didn't deter the bodacious blonde from becoming his third wife. "For me it meant more security knowing that with Hef, I'm the one for him," she said on <a href=#>HuffPost Live</a>. "There's always girls in and out, so there's always the feeling of maybe being replaced. It's an on-edge feeling all the time. So he made sure that I didn't feel that way anymore and that's what the wedding was all about."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacqqmowaK4jKGYq6qZqHqwuoysnLFlnJ6zpnnWoquhZZ6axG601KyZmqaUYrW2s8dmn56enpq%2FbrrOZpqopZ2au7V5kWlobG9iZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
