We can run him in the Long Distance Hurdle on Hennessy day at Newbury and go from there.</p><p>"If he's competitive there then we can go down that route and then if not we can then think about chasing.</p><p>"He'd never be an Arkle sort of horse anyway, one day he might be a Gold Cup staying chaser.</p><p>"He's just a proper stayer. Last year he was just never a natural over his hurdles.</p><p>"But he's ironed that out now and it's a great division to go and target. There are some obvious races for him and Newbury will tell us a lot and three miles won't be a problem.</p><p>"I think it's an open division too and if you go chasing the RSA will always have some serious horses knocking about.</p><p>"Harry said the others were all going some gallop and he was just cruising all over them in second gear. He's a lovely horse."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZLWwvtKeqZqbmaO0cH2RcXBpbWFufKS0xKmqraenYrqkssCbrKWnpah6sbHRrKCapl2srrN5z5qspWWenrCpu8ulqmg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
