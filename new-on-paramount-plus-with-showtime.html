She awakens one morning to discover a corpse in her home and no recollection of how it got there – or if she’s responsible. A survivor of the infamous Magdalene Laundries, a place where “fallen women” were taken to atone for their ‘sins,’ Lorna long has been plagued by bouts of sleepwalking. She’s also been haunted by vivid flashbacks of her time there, especially of watching a nun take her newborn baby away before she had a chance to hold it. Meanwhile, Detective Colman Akande (McCormack) arrives from Dublin to investigate the seemingly unrelated murder of an elderly priest. Struggling with demons from his own past, he finds himself drawn into a game of cat-and-mouse as both he and Lorna search for answers in a town full of long-buried secrets. Inspired by true events, The Woman in the Wall streams Jan. 19.</p><h2>Recently Premiered</h2><p><a href=#><strong>The World According to Football</strong></a><br>In this gripping, five-episode docuseries, South African writer, comedian, and former Daily Show host Trevor Noah takes a unique look at the world through its most popular game: soccer. (That’s “football” to most of the globe.) Arguably more than any other sport, soccer functions as a mirror to society – a mirror that sometimes shows us the best of ourselves, and other times, the very worst. Across five episodes, Noah uncovers stories from the USA, Brazil, France, Qatar, and the UK, examining players and coaches fighting against the status quo. Ultimately, he poses this critical question: if we can reform soccer, can we reform the societies it reflects?</p><p></p><p><a href=#><strong>Thriller 40</strong></a><br>In this documentary feature on the making of Michael Jackson’s Thriller, the best-selling album of all time worldwide, director Nelson George takes fans back in time to experience the making of the record-breaking album, as well as the release of the accompanying short films that forever redefined the music video format. Featuring never-before-seen footage and exclusive interviews with music and entertainment luminaries, Thriller 40 chronicles the creation of a pre-internet global phenomenon unlike anything before it or since. Thriller launched Jackson into mega-stardom, and continues to influence the worlds of music, dance, and fashion.</p><p></p><p><a href=#><strong>Fellow Travelers</strong></a><br>Nominated for two Golden Globe Awards®, including Best Television Limited Series, Anthology Series, or Motion Picture Made for Television, Fellow Travelers is an epic love story and political thriller based on the novel by Thomas Mallon, and created for television by Oscar® nominee Ron Nyswaner. The eight-episode limited series centers on Hawkins (“Hawk”) Fuller (Matt Bomer), who maintains a financially rewarding, behind-the-scenes career in politics. Hawkins avoids emotional entanglements – that is, until he meets Tim Laughlin (Jonathan Bailey), a young man brimming with idealism and religious faith. Over the course of four decades, we follow Hawk and Tim – as well as journalist Marcus (Jelani Alladin), senator’s daughter Lucy (Allison Williams), and nightclub performer Frankie (Noah J. Ricketts) – as they cross paths through Joseph McCarthy and Roy Cohn’s declaration of war on “subversives and sexual deviants,” the Vietnam War protests of the 1960s, the drug-fueled disco hedonism of the 1970s, and the AIDS crisis of the 1980s – all while facing obstacles in the world and within themselves. For his work as Hawk, Bomer received a Golden Globe Awards® nomination for Best Performance by a Male Actor in a Limited Series, Anthology Series, or a Motion Picture Made for Television.</p><p></p><p><a href=#><strong>The Curse</strong></a><br>The SHOWTIME® Original series The Curse is also a Golden Globe Awards® nominee. The series centers on Whitney and Asher Siegel, a newlywed couple struggling to bring their vision for eco-conscious housing to the small community of Española, New Mexico. But their efforts are complicated when an eccentrically flawed reality TV producer, Dougie, sees opportunity in their story. As the series unfolds, the couple find themselves caught in a mysterious web of ethical and moral gray zones – all while trying to keep their relationship afloat. The 10-episode series stars Oscar®-winner Emma Stone, Nathan Fielder, and Benny Safdie. For her work in The Curse, Stone received a Golden Globe Awards® nomination for Best Performance by an Actress in a Television Series, Drama.</p><span><a href=#>Try Paramount+ For Free!</a></span> &nbsp;<h2>Paramount+ with SHOWTIME® Plan – January 2024 Schedule</h2>Subscribers of the Paramount+ with SHOWTIME® plan can look forward to a January marked by original series premieres, the return of series favorites, and more.
