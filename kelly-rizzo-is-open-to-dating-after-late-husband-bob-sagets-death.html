She went on to say that she felt some “survivor’s guilt” after Saget’s death last year at age 65.</p><p>“You feel guilty if you have happy moments or if you’re not feeling sad all the time,” Rizzo continued. “You feel guilty about that, but then I learned that’s very normal. Now that enough time has passed, even his girls are always like, ‘That’s silly. Heavenly Bob wants you to be happy.’”</p><p>Rizzo joked that Saget might have felt differently while he was alive. “Earthly Bob would’ve been like, ‘Not too happy.’” she said.</p><p>Saget and Rizzo tied the knot in 2018 after <a href=#>three years of dating</a>. The late comedian was previously married to <strong>Sherri Kramer</strong>, with whom he shared daughters Aubrey, 36, Lara, 33, and Jennifer 30. Saget and Kramer, 67, divorced in 1997.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Kelly-Rizzo-Says-Open-to-Dating-After-Late-Husband-Bob-Saget-Death-2.jpg><p>Saget died in January 2022 after being found unresponsive in his hotel room in Orlando, Florida. One month later, authorities determined that <a href=#>Saget died as a result</a> of head trauma. “They have concluded that he accidentally hit the back of his head on something, thought nothing of it and went to sleep,” Saget’s family told Us Weekly in a statement in February 2022. “No drugs or alcohol were involved.”</p><p><a href=#>Rizzo has been open</a> about the emotional ups and downs she’s faced since Saget’s death. On the one-year anniversary of his passing, she shared a montage of some of their most memorable moments together.</p><p>“One Year. Our hearts are so heavy,” she wrote via Instagram in January. “How could I not have talked to or seen my loving husband in a whole year?. The surreal-ness never subsides. I’ve accepted the reality long ago but it still seems unreal when I see photos or videos of him so full of life.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>She went on to say that the “one thing” that makes her grief “survivable” is the fact that she got to spend even a few years with him.</p><p>“I am the luckiest that I got to be his wife,” she wrote. “I am the luckiest that I got to live with his warmth, and laughter, and brilliance, and love. I am the luckiest that I get to have his girls by my side. I am the luckiest that I got to watch him first hand help people, make them happy, and make the world a better place. Some people can live 1,000 lifetimes and never live a life as fully as he did. And to that I have to say, Well Done. You really won life, honey. And that is why I will be forever grateful for him and all the endless love he gave me, until my last day.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaknZyhxm6%2ByLOxqGWZqHqwvMSnZK2nXZmutbXNoGSanqSav264wK2cZqClqK%2BiusNmmaiaXaiuqLHTrGSdnZGptXA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
