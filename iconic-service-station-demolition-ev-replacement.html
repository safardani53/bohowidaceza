We’ve spent <a href=#>money</a> on it over the years and inside it’s kind of okay.</p><p>“But we’re not proud of it as a physical asset and we want to build a new one on the corner of the site and then level the old one.”</p><p>Mr Fox said Roadchef had already designed a “contemporary modern building” to replace the building - complete with air conditioning and charging facilities for up to 150 cars.</p><p>However, Catherine Croft, director of the Twentieth Century Society, which <a href=#>campaigns</a> to protect Britain’s iconic post-1914 buildings, said Watford Gap was a cultural and architectural icon.</p><p>She said its demolition would be a great loss.</p><p>Ms Croft said: “Service stations like Watford Gap celebrated the glamour and sense of possibility that travel within the UK offered, and in most cases made innovative use of new materials, both robust concrete on the exteriors and new synthetic fabrics, carpets and curtains in vibrant colours indoors.”</p><p>She added that the <a href=#>history</a> should perhaps be commemorated at the site once the building is gone.</p><p>She said: “Perhaps the saddest thing is that much of what made these places so exciting and special was down to the graphics, the furniture and the sense that they were at the time the only place likely to open for lonely night owls wanting to get together with a real mix of people. All long gone.</p><p>“We need a real counterpoint to the mediocrity and blandness we generally put up with at service stations today.”</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Roadchef is currently negotiating a new lease with the <a href=#>Department for Transport</a> (DfT) which owns both the northbound and southbound sites before starting any redevelopment.</p><p>A DfT spokesman said it was in discussions with the operators but was strongly supportive of moves to expand charging facilities.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/official-charts-company-pa-wire-855299189.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/members-psychedelic-pop-group-pink-352164077.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqamraeiqHxzgJVqbXFpZ2S2pLvNoppmq5Wnw6qvxGaqrZmknryvecOepKikmam2sLqMnq1mqpWluaKvxKacp6xf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
