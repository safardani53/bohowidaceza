However, Richard stepped down from his marketing executive position at the company in 2019.</p><p>So, what is he up to now?

The first, A Boy, a Burrito, and a Cookie: From Janitor to Executive, was released several years earlier in 2013.</p><p>“Don't take your position for granted, regardless of what that position may be. CEO or janitor, act like you own the company,” he said in The Boy, The Burrito, and a Cookie.</p><p>Today, Richard and his wife, Judy Montañez, are still married, and we really love that for them. Additionally, both their kids and grandkids are out here thriving, OK? The whole Montañez family makes frequent appearances on Richard’s feed, though, Judy doesn’t have much of a digital footprint at all.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Frito-Lay said Richard Montañez wasn’t *actually* the inventor of Hot Cheetos.</h2><p>While Richard is widely credited for creating Flamin’ Hot Cheetos, other parties have disputed those claims. Not long after he resigned from the company, the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Los Angeles Times</a> published an article that purported that wasn’t the inventor of the flavor, but rather one of the many moving pieces that made the magic happen.</p><p>"None of our records show that Richard was involved in any capacity in the Flamin' Hot test market. That doesn't mean we don't celebrate Richard, but the facts do not support the urban legend,” PepsiCo said in their statement to the outlet.</p><p>Later, Richard responded.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@hotcheetosrpm</a></figure><p>"I don't know what the other parts of the country, the other divisions — I don't know what they were doing. I'm not even going to try to dispute that lady, because I don't know. All I can tell you is what I did.
