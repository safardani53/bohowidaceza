What this team did and how we competed and all the guys in there rallying, we don’t really have one leader. That whole clubhouse is the leadership.”</p><p>The shortstop signed a 10-year, $325 million deal with the Rangers in 2022, hoping to help turn the team into an MLB juggernaut. It appears he’s succeeded thus far. The Rangers were the oldest franchise in the MLB without a World Series win — until now.</p><p>Seager made his MLB debut in 2015 after he was drafted to the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2012. In 2020, he was named the 2020 World Series MVP when the Dodgers <a href=#>took home the title that year</a>. After seven seasons on the team, he signed the largest contract in Rangers history and took his baseball skills to Texas.</p><p>“We’re trending upwards. [<strong>Chris Woodward</strong>] was a huge part of my decision,” Seager shared, explaining why he left the Dodgers for the Rangers during an April 2022 interview with MLB Network. “Knowing how he is, knowing how he approaches the game, knowing how I am and how I approach the game. The stars aligned.” (Woodward, 47, managed the Dodgers until August 2022.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Who-Is-Corey-Seager-5-Things-to-Know-About-the-World-Series-MVP-and-MLB-Shortstop-2.jpg><p>Seager also mentioned the Rangers’ current manager, <strong>Chris Young</strong>, and other front office members who have the “same mindset and same approach” when it comes to baseball. “That hits home, and it’s something you want to be part of,” Seager explained.</p><p>Seager had a major part in the <a href=#>Rangers’ 2023 World Series win</a> — and even his teammates admitted that.</p><p>“It was impressive to watch,” pitcher <strong>Jacob deGrom</strong> said of Seager, <a href=# rel=noopener>per Fox Sports</a>. “Every time he came up [to bat], you felt like he was going to do something special.”</p><p>Keep scrolling for everything to know about 2023 World Series MVP Seager:</p><h3>1.
