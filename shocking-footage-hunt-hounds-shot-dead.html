These hounds suffered immense pain.</p><p>"The activities shown in the video aren't actually illegal, but there's no moral defence for what's shown."</p><p>In response, the Duke of Beaufort's Hunt said the dogs are "humanely euthanised" if they cannot be rehomed.</p><p>But the videos - the first time a hunt has been captured shooting their hounds - have been condemned by celebrities and MPs.</p><h2>'INSANE'</h2><p>Animal rights vocalist Ricky Gervais said: "It is so deeply upsetting that foxhounds are trained against their natural instinct to hunt foxes and when they catch them, rip them to pieces!</p><p>"Then they are killed, usually by a shot to the head, by… someone who loves to chase and kill innocent animals. Both the hound and the fox become the victim of this cruelty. It's insane, don't you think?"</p><p>Tracey Crouch, co-chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Animal Welfare, said: "I don't understand why a dog…needs to be euthanised in this way and I am sure there are much more compassionate ways of putting a dog to sleep."</p><p>While Mike Jessop, a fellow of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, said he didn't believe the huntsmen were professionally trained to put animals down.</p><p>He added: "The evidence from the video doesn't show any illegal activity. My concern is whether there is any suffering after the shot, because nobody is being careful enough in checking the dogs are truly dead.</p><p>"In one of the videos, the [hound's] tail was still waggling very vigorously for quite some time, even when the dog was being loaded in the wheelbarrow.</p><p>"I would question, and be concerned, that that dog was still sentient, and therefore had the ability to feel pain."</p><h2>'HUMANELY EUTHANISED'</h2><p>It comes ahead of a vote later this month by the National Trust to decide to ban trail hunting on its land during the next hunting season.</p><p>The Duke of Beaufort's Hunt, also known at the Beaufort Hunt, is one of the oldest in England and dates back to 1640.</p><p>In a statement, the Duke of Beaufort's Hunt said: "A number of options are considered for every hound before any decision is made regarding their future, whether that is retirement or rehoming, either to a domestic environment or to another kennels where their country may be deemed more suitable for that individual hound.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>"Occasionally hounds are successfully retired as domestic pets, but they are not house-trained and have only ever been used to living in a pack environment so the majority are unfortunately unsuitable for rehoming.</p><p>"Where other options are not available, hounds are humanely euthanised. This is done by trained professionals using lawful and approved methods."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/hunt3.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/hunt2.png> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>Shocking video shows Scots 'use hawks to kill and hunt birds'</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfqrivsdasZmpuY2x%2Fd4SXaKqhp5Ogtq%2BzjJ%2BmqKyRnLJutNSnq2agn6q7pb%2BMrJ%2BorF2ZsqKwjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
