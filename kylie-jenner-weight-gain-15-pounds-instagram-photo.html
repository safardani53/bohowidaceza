While we must admit Kylie looks great here, we sincerely hope that she’s not worried about whatever weight she may have gained since this photo was taken.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Kylie is coming into her own as a style icon and she looks better than ever in our books. Plus, HELLO, did you see how shockingly tiny her waist looked in her Feb. 23 Instagram pic? If she did gain a few pounds, it looks like it went to all the right places, and we’re jealous.</p><h3>Kylie Jenner: I’m ‘Under Scrutiny All The Time’</h3><p id=content-paragraph-8>That said, if Kylie is having an insecure moment, we can totally understand why. As part of the famous Kardashian family, Kylie&nbsp;has to deal with loads attention from the press and public — not all of it positive. Plus, now that her sister <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kendall Jenner</strong></a>‘s modeling career has taken off, it’s possible that Kylie is feeling more pressure&nbsp;to be thinner.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>She <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>opened up about</a>&nbsp;her worries to&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Fault</a> magazine, saying:</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>“Being in my family, under scrutiny all the time… it affects the other people around me. My friends can get freaked out when they come into my world. It’s sad when you really think about it. There have been so many people that come into my family’s life that can’t handle it. And we handle a lot. The more people love you, the more there’s going to be people who hate you. So I just feel like the girl who is an easy target to talk about. It’s definitely been crazy, but I feel like we all have trust that we’re in it together and we try to focus on the positive.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-11><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, what do YOU think?
