Kirsten worked with Cailee on the upcoming film Civil War.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cailee-spaeny-update-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>The director offered Cailee the role of Priscilla during their first meeting. “Sofia pulled out her iPad and showed me some photos of Priscilla,” Cailee said. “She said, ‘I think you could do it!’ I felt like Kirsten had passed the torch to me.” And the rest is history!</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Cailee was able to speak with Priscilla several times before filming. Their first meeting was 4 hours long. Priscilla watched the biopic alongside Cailee at the Venice Film Festival. “She said, ‘That was a great performance.” That was the first time I’d ever heard that from her,” Cailee told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TODAY.com</a> about Priscilla’s reaction.</p><h2>Cailee Has a Close Bond With Co-star Jacob Elordi</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>Jacob, 26, stars as Elvis in Priscilla.

She became drawn to Sofia’s work at a young age.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Especially growing up in southern Missouri in the church, I felt like no one had ever really seen or accepted the teen angst a girl can have, the sadness within young teenage girls,” the actress told InStyle. “It wasn’t until I watched Sofia’s films that I was like, Oh, someone has acknowledged that you can be a young, cute girl but also have real darkness and angst in you, and this longing for another life or love or whatever it is.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cailee-spaeny-update-embed-1.jpg><h2>Cailee Made Her Film Debut in ‘Pacific Rim Uprising’</h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>Cailee was just 18 when she made her feature film debut in Pacific Rim Uprising.
