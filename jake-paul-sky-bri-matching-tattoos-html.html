Evidently, it wouldn't be readily visible in public as it would often be covered by clothing.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>"I would have thought that you like would like, go crazy,"&nbsp;Paul said while getting the tattoo.</p><h2>Jake Paul and&nbsp;Sky Bri Got Matching Tattoos</h2><p>As for the girlfriend, she got a tattoo of the YouTuber's name on the back of her neck. Her design reads, "Jakey P."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Much like Paul's body art, Bri's would also be hidden most of the time by her long blonde locks.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Although neither of the duo's inks&nbsp;explicitly read one another's names, the two are matching tattoos nevertheless.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>Suffice to say, the couple deciding to get matching tattoos this early in the relationship is a bold move.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>Not the First Matching Tattoo for Jake Paul</h2><p>This was not the first time the YouTuber got matching tattoos, though.&nbsp;</p><p>Back in May 2019, Paul and his "wife" Tana Mongeau got similar tats despite the latter being hesitant about it.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p>The duo got inked over at Paul's residence, and Mongeau outright stated that she would have the ink lasered off on a later date.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>She even suggested that getting matching tattoos with someone usually ruins the relationship, which was a weird comment considering their marriage was a sham.&nbsp;</p><p>Paul was with Mongeau before he was dating Rose.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>The two even got "married" in front of guests who signed up for the $50 pay-per-view event as a part of Mongeau's MTV reality show No Filter: Tana Mongeau.</p><p>The wedding was in July 2019, and the couple broke up not long after, in January 2020.
