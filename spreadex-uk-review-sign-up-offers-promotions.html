Its unique appeal is the fact you can bet on fixed odds and make spread bets – while also trading on the markets. This, to many people, makes Spreadex more than just a bookmaker or exchange.</p><p>In this review, we’ll take you through Spreadex’s latest bonuses, how you can sign up for an account, the banking methods available, and where you can claim free bets to enjoy the site further.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Spreadex sign up</h3></p><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/The-Sun-SpreadEX-Reviewed-By-Us.jpg><p class=article__content--intro>Get £40 in bet bonuses</p><p>18+ begambleaware.org.

Full T&Cs apply</p><p><strong><a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">SIGN UP</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Latest Spreadex offers and bonuses for sports</strong></h2><p>Spreadex is a fairly different style of bookie from what many are used to - partly because it's also a financial trading platform. However, the site still regularly presents deals and offers to new players and regular visitors.</p><p>Spreadex's bonus terms and conditions are typically very reasonable and easy to understand. However, it always pays to <strong>read the fine print</strong> in full before you activate a deal. For all offers, you'll need to be older than 18, and will need to prove your ID at registration. You'll also need to be a UK resident.</p><p>To activate bonuses at Spreadex, you’ll need to<strong> create a full account</strong> through either the website or app, pass registration, and place a qualifying bet.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Welcome bonus</strong></h3><p>Spreadex currently offers new customers<strong> up to five free £5 fixed odds bets and free spins on <a href=# aria-label="Starburst (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Starburst</a>.</strong> The two free spread bets are valid for total goals markets on football, and you’ll need to <strong>bet at least £10 with odds of at least 1/2.</strong></p><p>Once you settle this bet, <strong>you’ll receive your £5 spread freebies. </strong>The site warns that you can make losses on these bonuses – and, as always, full terms and conditions apply. For example, you won’t be able to use this deal at the same time as any other Spreadex promo.</p><p>Again, qualifying markets will apply, as do full terms and conditions – available to read on Spreadex’s website.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Accumulator bonuses</strong></h3><p>Right now, Spreadex isn’t offering any accumulator bonuses, but <strong>you can still enjoy accumulator bets</strong> through the site’s fixed odds section.</p><p>It’s always worth signing up for promotional emails and to keep an eye on Spreadex’s promotions page for the latest offers when they pop up. For example, Spreadex regularly runs <strong>bonuses based on big events and tournaments</strong>, such as the Football World Cup.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Offers by sports</strong><strong></strong></h3><p>Spreadex runs multiple deals and bonuses specific to football and <a href=# aria-label="horse racing (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">horse racing</a>, as well as for its <strong>fixed odds and spreads site-wide.</strong></p><p>Horse racing punters can claim cash back (as another free bet) <strong>if they lose out to a long-odds winner</strong>. If your horse finishes second to a winner marked at 33/1 or more, you can <strong>claim up to £25 back</strong>. It’s a fixed odds single race deal called ‘2nd to a rag’, and it’s open to all customers aged 18 or over.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>How to sign up at Spreadex - step by step</strong></h2><p>Here’s how you can sign up for an account at Spreadex in both desktop and app mode.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Signing up through the desktop site</strong></h3><li>Head to the main Spreadex site and click ‘<a href=#>join</a>’.</li><li>Fill out a membership application form. Make sure your details are accurate, as <strong>Spreadex will check information for fraud purposes.</strong></li><li>You may need to provide further information and proof of ID for your registration to approve. For example, <strong>you may need to provide photo ID and details of your employment.</strong> Spreadex assures that it won’t contact your employer.</li><li>Once your registration is filed, wait for the Spreadex team to contact you. You may be accepted straight away or in a few days, <strong>depending on the information needed.</strong></li><li>Once registered, you can <strong>log into the Spreadex site and start betting.</strong></li><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Signing up through the app</h3><li>Search for ‘Spreadex’ in the App Store and <a href=#>download the official sports app.</a></li><li>Tap ‘join’ in the top right corner of the app’s main screen.</li><li>You'll then need to fill out a membership form. Provide accurate details and proof of ID if asked.</li><li>Wait for Spreadex to approve your application, and log in once you’ve received an email acknowledgement.</li><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/The-Sun-SpreadEX-Reviewed-By-Us.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>How to place a bet</strong> on Spreadex</h2><p>At Spreadex, <strong>you can either place a spread bet or a fixed odds bet on sports. </strong>Fixed odds betting works much as you’d expect from other bookmakers.</p><p>To place a fixed odds bet, head to Spreadex’s sportsbook, select a market under a sport of your choice, and<strong> select ‘fixed odds’.</strong> You then set how much you’d like to bet. You’ll need to have active funds in your account to place a bet.</p><p>Fixed odds bets return money to you based on a fractional system. So, <strong>a 5/1 win would mean you get five times your initial bet back as profit.</strong></p><p>Spread betting can be a little more complex. <strong>By betting on the spread, you decide how right or wrong the bookmaker is</strong>. You can bet on how much higher, for example, you think the outcome range for a market will be. To do this, you ‘buy’ the spread. It works similarly to investing in stocks and shares.</p><p>To place spread bets at Spreadex, head to the main sportsbook. Choose a sport and market that appeals to you, and click or tap through until you see a list of odds. <strong>Make sure the tab is set to ‘spread betting’ rather than ‘fixed odds’.</strong></p><p>Not all markets offer spread betting, so look carefully through the sportsbook to find opportunities.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>How to get the most out of live streaming with Spreadex</strong></h2><p>Spreadex is one of several bookies that offer live streaming action on several sports and tournaments, covering football, horse racing, golf and more. <strong>The absolute best way to make the most of live streaming at Spreadex is to place in-play bets.</strong></p><p>Spreadex reportedly offers a wider range of in-play markets than most sports betting providers. This means you can choose from a variety of sports and markets to bet on <strong>while matches and races are mid-session.</strong></p><p>In-play betting with live streams allows you to <strong>place bets on markets and odds that evolve during play.</strong> For example, if you think Arsenal or Spurs will break a 0-0 deadlock in the last 10 minutes of a Premier League match, you’d select that market.</p><p>It’s an interesting new dimension of betting for many punters who are used to fixed futures ahead of time.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>How to claim your Spreadex bonus</strong></h2><p>Spreadex makes it easy for new punters to claim bonuses. In most cases, if you’re a new joiner, you can simply <strong>trigger bonus deals by making qualifying bets. </strong>However, this can vary from deal to deal, so always check the terms and conditions before you get started.</p><p>The same applies to existing customers getting into deals. Always check the terms expected of you before you start, as you may need to activate a bonus code. However, <strong>Spreadex largely runs on a ‘deposit to activate basis’.</strong></p><p>Taking Spreadex’s ‘Bet £10, Get up to £100’ bonus as an example, the necessary steps to claim your bonus are:</p><ul><li>Place your outright winner fixed odds £10 bet.</li><li>Collect your bonus – ranging from a £10 free spread bet, 30 free Starburst casino spins or a £10 free fixed odds bet.</li><li>As a final step, bettors can receive a free £10 fixed odds bet and 10 free Starburst spins each time the selected team wins.</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Spreadex payment methods</strong></h2><p>Spreadex accepts payments via the following methods:</p><ul><li><strong>UK debit cards (MasterCard, Maestro, Switch, Visa)</strong></li><li><strong>Bank transfers</strong></li><li><strong>Cheques</strong></li><li><strong>Direct Debit mandates</strong></li></ul><p>At present, Spreadex doesn’t accept payments from e-wallets or via crypto. Full details are available via the main website.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Spreadex withdrawal options</strong></h3><p>Spreadex currently supports withdrawals through the following channels:</p><ul><li><strong>Bank transfers</strong></li><li><strong>Direct Debit transfers</strong></li><li><strong>UK debit cards (MasterCard, Switch, Maestro, Visa)</strong></li><li><strong>Cheques</strong></li></ul><p>A minimum of £50 per withdrawal applies, providing there’s no margin left to clear on open positions on your account.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Spreadex minimum deposit</strong></h3><p>Spreadex stands apart from most sportsbooks in that <strong>there’s no minimum deposit requirement.</strong> Simply pay in enough to cover the bets you wish to make.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>How to use the Spreadex cash out feature</strong></h2><p>Spreadex supports <strong>partial and full cash out.</strong> To activate either option, simply make sure to tick the ‘one-click cash out’ box when viewing the bets in your account.</p><p>You can then close your bets early if you wish, simply by activating the feature when you view your active bets. You can cash out a partial amount on singles and multiples, providing they're fixed odds bets – <strong>simply use the slider function to choose what you’d like to withdraw.</strong></p><p><strong>You can also use ‘auto’ cash out to <a href=# aria-label="withdraw cash from a bet (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">withdraw cash from a bet</a> if you make a certain amount of profit. </strong>You can set these limits by clicking or tapping the ‘settings cog’ next to any bets you’re editing.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Free bets at Spreadex</strong></h2><p>The main <a href=# aria-label="free bets (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">free bets</a> offer available at Spreadex right now ties into its <strong>recommend-a-friend deal. </strong>Simply refer a friend to the site and ask them to quote your name and postcode when they sign up and you can <strong>claim a free £100 total goals spread bet.</strong></p><p>You’ll get to claim this bet <strong>after your friend places five bets that qualify (of at least £2 each). </strong>Full terms and conditions apply.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>More reviews of online UK bookmakers</h2><h2><strong>Remember to gamble responsibly</strong></h2><p><strong>A responsible gambler is someone who:</strong></p><ul><li>Establishes time and monetary limits before playing</li><li>Only gambles with money they can afford to lose</li><li>Never chase their losses</li><li>Doesn’t gamble if they’re upset, angry, or depressed</li><li>Gamcare –&nbsp;<a href=#>www.gamcare.org.uk</a></li><li>Gamble Aware –&nbsp;<a href=#>www.begambleaware.org</a></li></ul><p>Find our <a href=# aria-label="detailed guide on responsible gambling practices here (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">detailed guide on responsible gambling practices here</a>.</p><p>For help with a gambling problem, call the National Gambling Helpline on 0808 8020 133 or go to&nbsp;<a href=#>www.gamstop.co.uk</a>&nbsp;to be excluded from all UK-regulated gambling websites.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Betting</h2></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jpucrayZo7Rwfo9xanJqYGd8tLzRnpidnahiwqx50Z6top2nYsCqs81mrKlln5uzpr7SZqerp52kwaq7zaxm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
