The family of five were seen making their way to St. George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle on Sunday, April 9 — marking a return for youngest Louis, who was absent last year. The littlest Wales was the only one in the group to wear a pair of breezy baby blue shorts for the official service, paired with knee high socks and a traditional blazer with tie.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Prince-William-Kate-Middleton-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>Prince Louis held onto his mom’s hand, who looked absolutely regal in a royal blue ensemble. The future Queen of England wore a ankle length blue coat and matching hat, paired with a pair of nude suede pumps that are likely from her go-to brand,<strong> Gianvito Rossi</strong>. Eagle eyed followers may recognize the Catherine Walker & Co coat dress, which she previously sported at the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>2022 Commonwealth Day Service</a>. The Lock & Co pillbox hat has also made a re-appearance from a St. Patricks Day outing last year. She also made a statement with her surprising red nail polish, which is dramatically different than typical clear or nude shades sported by her and other members of the family.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Prince-William-Kate-Middleton-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Charlotte also looked adorable in a blue floral printed sundress with a Peter Pan collar, keeping her hair down with the front layers pinned back. She also added tights to the outfit, and a coat — but later ditched the outwear which mom Kate held onto after the service. Finally, Prince William was dapper in a dark navy suit matching his eldest son, George, both with shirts and ties. George has more recently been wearing a full suit, a transition<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> away from shorts</a>, which are worn by younger boys in Britain for such events.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>All three royal kids were seen giving handshakes to the pastor as they left the church service — including Louis, who first made a similar appearance on Christmas Day.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Notably, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>King Charles</strong></a> and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Queen Camilla</strong></a> were also seen in blue for Easter Sunday, keeping the theme going for the special occasion.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH11e49yZqmqmaOwpnnWoqOloZGieqyt055kpqGUmbmmwM6nZKCdn6e0pnnLqKyiq12YtaK%2By6irrZ1dmq60wMSrZKitpJu2tXnPoaatp6Nk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
