You don’t have to be a New Yorker to feel the inconspicuous shift of the seasons around you before the foliage turns gold — but you do have to have a wardrobe full of fall-ready fashions awaiting the pumpkin spice coffee runs, trips to the orchards, and autumnal events ahead. And who better to look to for fall style inspiration than the queen of New York City herself?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I believe Carrie has a refined fashion eye and she seeks out unusual pieces and places to style with her classics,” <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Molly Rogers</a>, the costume designer for And Just Like That..., tells PEOPLE. “Carrie is whimsical and fearless in a way…her clothes reflect a joie de vivre.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Bradshaw’s fictitious life is filled with fabulous outings and a tumultuous dating scene, but the one thing that transcends time about this character is her eccentric wardrobe and hard-to-pin style. We all know her Bird of Paradise headpiece and iconic tulle skirt from Sex and The City's opening credits, but what tricks would she pull this season?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“If I were dressing Carrie for fall 2023, I’d be looking for color — as Carrie is in a happy place in life and would want to express that,” Rogers adds. She imagines Bradshaw “hunting for a puffy Japanese headscarf or finding a vintage cape” in NYC stores, all while mixing and matching with high-low pieces, in true Carrie fashion.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As to what the next season of AJLT has in store in terms of fashion, we’ll have to wait and see.

Though these may be some of the rarest times that she goes for comfort, her knitwear is anything but boring. Rogers gives a nod to fun sweaters as an easy way to make an outfit more interesting while keeping things comfortable.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I love an oversized jacket or sweater as a layering piece,” she says. “So easy to usher them into a look and give it extra panache.” Her tips on how to style them like Bradshaw would? “Use a cardigan as a vest — use a vest as a T-shirt. Experiment! But stay cozy.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">From Carrie’s warm-toned sweater moment to a Western-chic skirt and pink knit combo, we’ve gotten all the inspiration we needed for our own fall haul. Taking Rogers’ colorful and creative outlook on Carrie’s 2023 style into mind, we found a few sweaters that will take any autumn outfit and transform it into a Carrie-approved look fit for a stroll through Central Park.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Get the Carrie Look:</span></h3><span class=heading-toc id=toc-dokotoo-loose-oversized-turtleneck-sweater></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Dokotoo Loose Oversized Turtleneck Sweater</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">An oversized sweater is the pinnacle of cozy fall fashion, if you ask us, and this chunky knit from Amazon checks all the boxes for us. With its thick cable-knit material and exaggerated turtleneck and sleeves, this sweater is the perfect way to bring Carrie’s SATC style into 2023 without going over budget.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">We think Carrie’s eye would land on this vibrant green (calling back to Rogers’ note on color), though you can choose from 10 other muted tones to see which one meshes the best with your current fall wardrobe. Pair it with a tulle maxi skirt for a look that really screams Carrie.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Price at time of publish: $38.99 (orig. $55.99)</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>60% cotton, 40% acrylic | <strong>Sizes:</strong> S-XXL | <strong>Fit:</strong> Oversized | <strong>Colors:</strong> 11 | <strong>Care:</strong> Machine wash on cold, hang dry</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-grey-bandit-manhattan-sweater></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Grey Bandit Manhattan Sweater</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Grey Bandit</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If the name alone doesn’t make you understand why this sweater deserves spot on this list, then its likeness to Carrie’s marled, striped sweater will paint a clearer picture. This chunky sweater features a striped knit fabric and oversized, drop-shoulder silhouette, with balloon sleeves adding a bit of exaggeration to this classic sweater.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">You can opt for the “stone” color to channel Bradshaw’s varying shades of brown in her original outfit, or choose from black and white or green and white, depending on your personal style. If you really want to make like Carrie, you can add a <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">small floral bag</a> to your look to contrast the print, yet simultaneously pull everything together.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Price at time of publish: $62</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>100% polyester | <strong>Sizes:</strong> XS-XL | <strong>Fit:</strong> True to size | <strong>Colors:</strong> 3 | <strong>Care:</strong> Hand wash on cold, hang dry&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-cara--the-sky-megan-stripe-roll-neck-jumper-cherry></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Cara & The Sky Megan Stripe Roll Neck Jumper Cherry</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Wolf & Badger</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If there were ever a sweater that we could see Carrie running across New York City streets in, it’s this multicolor, striped turtleneck from Cara & The Sky. This red, yellow, and purple knit still feels like a fall palette while playing into Carrie’s characteristically colorful style.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The sweater most closely mimics the silhouette of the brown, striped chunky turtleneck Carrie wore in the park due to its thick, rolled neck and wide sleeves — a piece that can be paired with other unexpectedly Carrie elements (think sequin mini skirts for an evening outing or a wide-leg pair of pants to make everything more modern). If the colors on this one are just a bit too much, there’s a gray, white, and baby blue option, as well.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Price at time of publish: $114</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>76% acrylic, 24% nylon | <strong>Sizes:</strong> S-L | <strong>Fit:</strong> True to size, size up for a looser fit | <strong>Colors:</strong> 2 | <strong>Care:</strong> Machine wash, hang dry</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-farm-rio-pink-croco-knit-cardigan></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Farm Rio Pink Croco Knit Cardigan</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Farm Rio</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Rogers called out cardigans as a must-have for fall, so we couldn’t help but wonder if Carrie would gravitate toward this busy Farm Rio button-up. The super soft material features an array of geometric crocodiles against a medium-pink backdrop, with a slightly elongated hemline that compliments the sweater’s loose frame.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-66 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">You can pair this cardi with the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">matching midi skirt</a> (a very Carrie move, if we do say so ourselves) or add a pair of equally patterned, contrasting pants to make a SATC-inspired statement that will keep heads turning on crosswalks all season long.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Price at time of publish: $170</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-70 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Rayon, viscose | <strong>Sizes:</strong> XXS-XL | <strong>Fit:</strong> Loose | <strong>Colors:</strong> 1 | <strong>Care:</strong> Machine wash, hang dry, iron on low heat</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-statement-jackets></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-72 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Statement Jackets</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-73 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Arnaldo Magnani/Getty; James Devaney/WireImage</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-74 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Aside from Bradshaw’s fabulous collection of Manolos and bird-inspired purses, her cold-weather outfits are never complete without an eye-catching coat. Rogers calls out Carrie’s vintage fur as her favorite fall jacket, and that it was actually one of the first items purchased for the character between 1997 and 1998. “I really do love when someone takes an old coat of any kind and gives it a new life,” Rogers says. “We didn’t know until years later that it unzips into a jacket,” she adds, calling Carrie an “upcycle pioneer.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-76 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Another favorite for the costume designer was Carrie’s multicolored jacket that she adorned during the finale of Sex and the City’s fourth season during Miranda’s labor scene. “It had such a glossy shine…looked like a fall city street,” Rogers recalls.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-78 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But in today’s day and age, Caroline Vazzana, a content creator and self-proclaimed “modern-day Carrie Bradshaw,” believes that the character would veer on the imitative side of things now — at least when it comes to fur. “[Carrie] is obviously known for her furs, but in 2023, I feel like she’s going with faux fur,” Vazzana tells PEOPLE. “I think there’s so many fun and colorful faux fur options today; I can really see Carrie leaning into an oversized hot pink faux fur.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-80 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Colors, textures, and patterns alike, these are the statement jackets that evoked Carrie’s glamour in modern-day fashion.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-82 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Get the Carrie Look:</span></h3><span class=heading-toc id=toc-uo-tasha-faux-fur-corduroy-longline-coat></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-85 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>UO Tasha Faux Fur Corduroy Longline Coat</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-86 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Urban Outfitters</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-89 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Carrie’s original fur was a neutral-toned midi coat, but a modern way to channel this look is with a faux fur jacket like this pick from Urban Outfitters, which comes in olive green and bright blue. This longline coat is decorated with lapels and cuffs adorned with imitation fur and can be tied at the waist with a matching corduroy belt (essential for keeping out the cold).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-91 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">You can button up the center placket or wear it open for a free-flowing look like Carrie, so long as you have a mismatched, yet completely chic outfit arranged underneath. (Or pair it with pajamas and ankle boots like only Carrie would as she rushed to Miranda’s on New Year’s Eve). Whichever way you style it, you’re sure to make a statement — and just in case you’re wondering, we think Carrie would go with the blue.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-93 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Price at time of publish: $129</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-95 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>100% cotton | <strong>Sizes:</strong> XS-XL | <strong>Fit:</strong> True to size | <strong>Colors:</strong> 2 | <strong>Care:</strong> Dry clean</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-lulus-too-fab-for-you-pink-faux-fur-coat></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-97 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Lulus Too Fab For You Pink Faux Fur Coat</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-98 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Lulus</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-101 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This pink faux fur feels right out of Vazzana’s reverie with its oversized silhouette and over-the-top color. Its shawl collar and long fur strands make this jacket a colorful, yet equally fabulous version of Carrie’s go-to fur coat, just in faux form, which makes everything all the more modern.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-103 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">We’ve seen Bradshaw pair everything from mini skirts and knee-high boots to pajamas and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>high heels</a> underneath her iconic furs, but we think a great way to make this statement piece more “everyday” is by slipping into a simple dress or <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>a pair of jeans</a> with a classic tee to make this look perfect for fall.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-105 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Price at time of publish: $152</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-107 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>100% polyester | <strong>Sizes:</strong> XS-XL | <strong>Fit:</strong> Oversized | <strong>Care:</strong> Hand wash cold, line dry</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-something-new-cleo-faux-leather-trench-coat></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-109 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Something New Cleo Faux Leather Trench Coat</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-110 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-113 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Carrie has never been one to shy away from statement-making outerwear, and the 2023 version of the glossy jacket that Rogers likened to a “fall city street” is a shiny, vinyl trench. Leaning into Rogers’ colorful palette is this bright pink faux-leather trench, which can be belted at the waist for a figure-defined look or tied behind the back for an outfit-baring ensemble.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-115 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But if you want to give a nod to Carrie’s darker, autumnal jacket while still keeping things in the year 2023, this <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">patent olive trench</a> is an understated, yet eye-catching piece that will flatter your fall outfits while still keeping the reflective essence of Carrie’s jacket alive.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-117 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Price at time of publish: $209</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-119 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>100% polyester with polyurethane coating | <strong>Sizes:</strong> 2-8 | <strong>Fit:</strong> True to size | <strong>Care:</strong> Machine wash, dry flat</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-allegra-k-notched-lapel-double-breasted-blazer></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-121 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Allegra K Notched Lapel Double Breasted Blazer</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-122 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-125 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A hallmark of Bradshaw’s style? Patterns — and lots of them. We know Carrie to be fond of blazers throughout the several show seasons, movies, and spin-offs that we’ve seen them in, and we know her eye would be drawn to this fall-red tartan blazer. Contrasting hues of green and red dance within the plaid print that decorates this blazer, and we can imagine her finishing the look with a pointed-toe Manolo heel and a wonderfully complicated skirt (naturally, in a contrasting print).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-127 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Use this as your statement piece with a pair of black leather pants or pull on a flowy midi skirt with this blazer as a top for a look that feels Rogers-approved.

Carrie’s choice of a flashy kitten heel or sculptural bag is what piques fans’ attention and keeps them coming back for more. Rogers explains that the character’s quirky style has created a sense of nostalgia in fans who’ve admired her eccentricity for decades. “Like Carrie at Gramercy Park with a straw beret on,” she points out. “It’s heightened fashion, and that’s what people like to see on her.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-137 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When you take a few pages from Carrie’s book, it’s easy to take any simple fall ‘fit and elevate it into something more Manhattanite.

The designer tells PEOPLE that we’re “going to see a lot of chunky boots” this fall, from runways to window displays. The Fella boot from Steve Madden feels like a pared-down version of the perched pumps that Carrie’s known for, taking an edgier approach to fall footwear with its lug sole (and controversial 1.5-inch heels).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-148 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Its sculpted block heel makes this shoe not only easier to walk in, but structurally interesting to look at (a perfect combo for taking on the city streets). Keep the look going with a sleek leather jacket — and maybe a patterned skirt — to pull together a very Carrie autumn outfit.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-150 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Price at time of publish: $59.98 (orig. $149.95)</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-152 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Leather | <strong>Sizes:</strong> 5.5-10 | <strong>Fit:</strong> True to size | <strong>Colors:</strong> 4 | <strong>Care:</strong> Hand wash</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-marinos-genuine-leather-dress-belt></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-154 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Marino’s Genuine Leather Dress Belt</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-155 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-158 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Rogers says that her go-to accessory for Carrie flair is any kind of belt. “It can be a man’s belt, a chunky belt, or [you can] put two together to make it extra long,” she adds. The most budget-friendly item on our list is this classic black belt, a medium-thick leather body with a single-prong closure that can elevate any outfit — depending on how you wear it. “Belt a sweater by crossing it over, belt a coat instead of buttoning it,” Rogers suggests.

From the chunky, lug sole design to its gold hardware, these loafers feel like the only realistic “flats'' that Carrie would go for this season (though both Rogers and fellow AJLT costume designer, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Danny Santiago</a>, do confirm that Carrie does, in fact, own sneakers).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-170 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I know she’s such a heels girl, but I can see her rocking <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>a loafer</a> and a sock,” says Vazzana. SJP herself is known to rock a flat (and even <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nocaes>designs her own</a>), so statement loafers feel like a natural, and dare we say edgier, choice for a Bradshaw wardrobe — even if it will mess up the continuity of stilettos in her stacked wardrobe.
