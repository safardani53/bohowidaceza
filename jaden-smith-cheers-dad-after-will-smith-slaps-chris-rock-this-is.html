G.I. Jane 2, can’t wait to see ya," Chris joked.</p><p>In the Demi Moore film (the first G.I. Jane), the main character receives a dramatic buzz cut.</p><p>Actors often receive special attention for dramatically altering their real life appearance for a role, as Demi did for that haircut.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>In other words, Chris was mocking Jada’s hair loss.</p><p>Will took a couple of seconds to process the joke, observed his wife’s reaction, and had a reaction of his own.</p><p>Specifically, he walked up onto the stage and slapped Chris Rock across the face.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>The audience reactions were priceless. So were many of the reactions of viewers at home.</p><p>"Oh wow," Chris said, clearly processing what had happened.</p><p>"Will Smith just smacked the s–t out of me," he remarked, stunned.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Back in his seat, Will called out: "Keep my wife’s name out your f–king mouth!"&nbsp;</p><p>"Wow, dude, it was a G.I. Jane joke," the comedian protested.</p><p>This prompted Will to reiterate: "Keep my wife’s name out your f–king mouth!"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>"I’m going to, okay?" Chris promised.</p><p>"That was the … greatest night in the history of television," he remarked, and not incorrectly.</p><p>From there, he went on to hand out the next award.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The responses that you saw on social media likely depend upon which people you follow, and which social media platforms you use.</p><p>On Facebook, you probably saw a lot of hand-wringing and slippery slope arguements and probably a touch of racism here or there.</p><p>On Tumblr, the takes could only be characterized as "gleeful" with the occassional "I have no idea who these men are."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Twitter saw both kinds of takes.</p><p>One doctor sincerely wrote a "what if" suggesting that things would have been worse had Will struck late great comedians like Betty White or Bob Saget.</p><p>Her ratio was so severe that, despite her obvious desire for attention, she went private.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Another person claimed that Will had learned to employ violence at others as part of Scientologist indoctrination.</p><p>That’s not true for a couple of reasons — for one, Scientologists who are not David Miscavige are not supposed to be violent, though yelling and screaming may be part of their behavior.</p><p>The other is, more significantly, that Will and Jada are not part of the Church of Scientology. That infamous organization loves to flaunt its famous members; they are not among them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>On the other side of things, some claimed that objecting to violence was, in this case, racist.</p><p>While there were certainly responses tinged with racism, that argument is a bit of a stretch.</p><p>Many people are allowed to have nuanced feelings about a complicated topic — violence in defense of a man’s wife and her health condition — without deserving insults.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>To Jaden, of course, this was his mom being insulted on stage by a comedian who has made fun of her before.</p><p>Chris Rock — who is no stranger to controversy — crossed a line.</p><p>People as a whole may feel divided over whether Will’s response was appropriate, but clearly it struck the right chord with Jaden.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2tqX2WAcLbAnZynZaOitrW0jJyfnp2iqHqlrcNmmJ%2Bslad6uLXLpWSspZmptW6%2Fy5qnrGWTnb%2Bqv4yrppyjXam1qr%2BMoqpo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
