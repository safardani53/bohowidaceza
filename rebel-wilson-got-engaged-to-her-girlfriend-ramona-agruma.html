Page Six received confirmation of their engagement from inside sources:</p><p>“They were kissing in a corner, telling everyone how happy they were to be engaged.”</p><p>The engagement took place “a couple of weeks ago,” according to the tabloid, and the newly engaged couple has been wearing diamond rings on their fingers since.&nbsp;According to another source, Wilson is “wildly delighted” about the next phase in her relationship with Agruma. Prior to her relationship with her partner, the Pitch Perfect actor dated Jacob Busch, the inventor of Napp’s Dairy Free Ice Cream and a Budweiser heir.</p><p>However, the couple split up in February 2021. After dating a “bunch of people,” Wilson told the U Up? podcast that she was figuring out what she “liked” and “didn’t like.” She stated:</p><p>“I really pushed myself to date a lot of people and get that experience, which I know is not typical, but it really helped me figure out what I loved and didn’t like.”</p><p>She went on to say that she was “happy” seeing someone she met at a friend’s set-up:</p><p>“I met [my spouse] during a friend’s get-together.” He’d known both of us for at least five years and assumed we’d get along – and then we did! I can believe that they are who they say they are, which you don’t always get with [dating] applications.”</p><p>Rebel Wilson made her relationship with Ramona Agruma public in June.</p><h2>Rebel Wilson and Ramona Agruma were introduced via a mutual acquaintance.</h2><p>Wilson said in May 2022 that she had spent some time “on and off” on the VIPs dating app Raya before meeting her spouse via a mutual acquaintance. Despite not revealing her identity, the actress said that she was “happy in a relationship.” Wilson announced her romance with Ramona Agruma, CEO of the sustainable fashion label Lemon Ve Limon, on Instagram the following month. The former posted a selfie with her girlfriend and told her followers:</p><p>“I assumed I was looking for a Disney Prince… But maybe what I actually wanted all along was a Disney Princess. #loveislove.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Rebel-wilson-1.jpg alt="Rebel wilson" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The pair continued to record their adventure on social media, sharing photos from Iceland, Turkey, and Italy. Wilson was “glad all around,” a source told US Weekly in July, with her new romance, profession, and successful weight reduction journey.&nbsp;They also said that the Isn’t It Romantic actress was relieved to be seen in public:</p><p>“Even though she wasn’t totally ready to share something so personal to her with the whole world [last month], she’s pleased she did and that she was the one to share it.”</p><p>According to the source, the post eased a “big weight” off Rebel Wilson’s shoulders since she is glad that she would no longer have to keep her relationship hidden because she will be free to share “pictures and beautiful moments” of her and Agruma with followers.&nbsp;Wilson also admired her girlfriend’s modest demeanor, according to the insider, and the two had a lot in common:</p><p>“Rebel admires Ramona’s warmth and the fact that they share many interests.” They’re taking things slowly at the moment, but they’re thrilled to see what the future brings. Friends are overjoyed for Rebel and enthusiastic about her new connection.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Rebel-wilson-2.jpg alt="Rebel wilson" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>According to Page Six, the pair got engaged a few weeks ago and were wearing diamond rings on October 28 at George Clooney’s Casamigos Halloween party.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGipnpqVoXq4tcuspqdll6TBbrHNoJignZRiwbB5x56pZp%2BZp7mnvsiepZ1lopa6sLrAZpigqqWirnA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VoxVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
